            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving been choſen by your Suffrage a fourth time to ſerve as one of your Clerks in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, I have endeavour'd on all Occaſions, as my great Age and mean Abilities permitted, and God's Bleſſing, enabled me, to defend the Church as by Law eſtabliſhed, againſt all its Adverſaries: and being unexpectedly invited by the Worthy Dr. <hi>Charles Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> to declare what I had obſerved concerning the Author of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who was pleaſed to ſend me Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Libel, wherein he affirms, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>was the Author of that Book.</hi> Among other Remarks which I ſent to Dr. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> upon Dr. <hi>W.</hi>'s Book, I ſent him my own Teſtimony in theſe words: <hi>I had the hap to be acquainted with Bp.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>as long as he was our Dioceſan, and I have often heard him affirm, that he was fully convinced that the</hi>

               <hi>was intirely that King's Work.</hi> How this Teſtimony of mine came to the knowledge of Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> who was then writing againſt Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> is not material, but I received a Letter from him deſiring that I would communicate my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to him, for which I referred him to Dr. <hi>Goodall,</hi> from whom I ſuppoſe he received a Copy of my Teſtimony, Shortly after this, there came forth a third Letter of <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s, and in <hi>p.</hi> 16. of a Preface to that Book, I found my Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny repeated, and my Perſon reflected on, which I accounted
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:99534:3"/>a great Honour, as being defamed by a Regicide in Defence of our Royal Martyr, this was one Motive to engage me for the farther Confirmation of my Teſtimony, which how well I have performed, I ſubmit to your Judgments. This Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony was ſo acceptable to both the Doctors, that they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited me for my farther Aſſiſtance in this Buſineſs; and Dr. <hi>Goodal</hi> who moſtly encouraged me by ſeveral Teſtimonies which were very material, preſt on me the Proſecution of this Subject, becauſe Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Pamphlet by his frequent and ſolemn Appeals to God had altered the Opinions of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our own Church, and Multitudes of Diſſenters; and that as well Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s as <hi>Ludlow</hi>'s Libels did equally tend to Subverſion of Monarchy and Epiſcopacy, as now by Law eſtabliſhed; theſe things prevailed with me to Review Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s true Account, as he calls it, and finding it to be falſe, ſcandalous, inconſiſtent, and contradictory to itſelf, and to have no Foundation beſides the bare Aſſertion of a Vain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I reſolved to joyn Iſſue with him on his own Propoſal, in the laſt Page of his Libel, <hi>That if any Man can produce ſtronger Reaſons for the negative part,</hi> viz <hi>that Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>was not the Author, than he hath for the affirmative,</hi> he ſays, <hi>he not only will, but must believe that contrary part.</hi> The Caſe therefore is devolved on the Determination of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whom I only deſire to conſider the Arguments and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities which I have produced for ſtopping of that falſe and malicious Rumor, which hath been a long time muttered in every Corner, but now is proclaimed on the Houſe-top, and like Peſtilential Diſeaſes on crazy Bodies, hath ſeized Men of weak Heads and corrupt Hearts; which being warmly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the infected Party, who with <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> and reſiſt the Truth, ſhall proceed no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for their Folly ſhall be manifeſt to all Men, by</p>

            <p>IT is an unaccountable Piece of Malice that in twelve Years after the Barbarous Murder of <hi>CHARLES the Firſt,</hi> wherein his bloudy Enemies wanted neither Power nor Diligence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that Monument which he had erected in his Life-time, ſtood ſtill firm and inviolable; and after more than thirty Years, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church and Royal Family were reſtored to a quiet Enjoyment of their Ancient Rights and Splendor, and both Church and State acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their Preſervation due to the Unconquerable Fortitude and Patience of the <hi>Royal Martyr;</hi> in witneſs whereof they ordained, (as bound in Duty and Gratitude) that the Memorial of that <hi>Juſt Man</hi> might be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by recording Him in their <hi>Rubrick</hi> as their <hi>Royal Martyr,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Day of Humiliation and Prayer for the Averſion of thoſe Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the Guilt of ſhedding his Innocent Bloud, from which we are not cleanſed to this Day; that there ſhould be found ſuch Monſters of Men as ſhould endeavour to Murder Him a ſecond time, and charge Him again in the ſight of the Nation, as a Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer, and (what His most Unrighteous Judges durst not charge Him with, as) a Papist. All which Calumnies have been lately ſpread through the Nation, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Libels, under the name of that Impious Regicide <hi>Ludlow,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Judgment was not ſpeedily executed on him, hath ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing more Miſchief; nor doth that Son of <hi>Belial</hi> want the Aſſiſtance and Applauſe of too many, who ſuch up his venemous Poyſon, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come profeſſed Enemies to Epiſcopacy in the Church, and Monarchy in the State; and becauſe their Predeceſſors prevailed ſo far againſt the moſt Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Innocent of Kings, and the beſt of the Reformed Churches, as to kill and take poſſeſſion of their Inheritances; having now, as <hi>Milton</hi> ſays, loſt their Paradiſe, they attempt to regain it, by the ſame Methods as were uſed in <hi>1640:</hi> The Government being now eſtabliſhed in the Hands of the moſt Heroick and Religious King and Queen in all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and under them the Church conſiſting of ſuch a Learned and Pious
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:99534:4"/>Clergy, as maintain their Renown of being <hi>Stupor Mundi.</hi> He ſticks not to juſtifie them whoſe Deeds teſtifie that they are the Off-ſpring of thoſe who deſtroyed the Lord's Anointed, and killed his Prophets; and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Regicide, Sacriledge, and Murthering of Vicegerents, and thoſe that God had ſent as his Ambaſſadors among them, and perſwades them, that they did God ſervice in thoſe Barbarities. What Prince, or what Church can be ſafe, if they ſhould (which God forbid) fall under the Power of Men of ſuch Principles, who ſought to deſtroy Monarchy; with the beſt of Monarchs, and with Him the best Reformed Church.</p>
            <p>The Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the First for ſeventeen Years together, was ſuch as the Prophet deſcribes, Pſal. <hi>144. When our ſons grew up as young plants, and our daughters were as the poliſhed corners of the temple; when there was no leading into captivity, no breaking or invaſion of the land, no decay of our ſtores, our ſheep or oxen.</hi> And yet what Murmuring and Complaining was there in all our Streets? There was no Bloud ſhed in all that time, until this Generation of Men grew intoſlerable by affronting, and publiſhing Factious and Seditious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels against both the King and Church; and then a few Marks of ſuch as openly began our Diviſions, were ſet on ſome of them, that others might avoid their pernicious Ways, ſuch as <hi>Prin, Burton,</hi> and <hi>Baltwick,</hi> the first of which confest, That if his Head had been cut off when his Ears were cropt, he had deſerved it. The Arch-biſhops Speech hath truly ſet forth their Attempts and Deeds. And as for the Condition of the Church, the Care of the Governours was, that we might worſhip God in Holineſs and Beauty too, ſo that the King's Daughter might not only be glorious within, but her Garments might be of Needle work.</p>
            <p>Such by the Bleſſing of God is our preſent Condition; but that we may ceaſe to wonder at theſe Men, Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that was a Member of our Church, one that admired the Parts and Piety of the <hi>Holy Martyr,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forty three Years, ſhould ſeek to deface the Portraicture of that <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous King,</hi> and deprive the People of that precious Depoſitum, than which we have not a more ſacred Relick of any of the Martyrs and Fathers, ſince the Apoſties days, is matter of Wonder and Aſtoniſhment: He tells us, that the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>By the Biſhop's order I preached in the Afternoon, my Text was the Evangelical Promiſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing-fathers, and their Queens thy nurſing-mothers.</hi> Whereon as occaſion offered, I aggravated that deteſtable Parricide perpetrated on the Perſon of the Royal Martyr; and among other Arguments I urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Piety and Clemency of that moſt excellent Prince, reading out of his Book ſeveral Paragraphs to that purpoſe: and one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a Speech to the Commiſſioners at <hi>Newport,</hi> againſt ſome that thought him Revengeful, <hi>That he was ſo far from ſeeking Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, that if a Straw lay in their way to hurt them, he would ſtoop and take it up to prevent it.</hi> (Adding,) <hi>God forgive them, for I do.</hi> The Duties of the Faſt being over, I was invited to ſup with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and ſtanding with him by the Fire-ſide, he gave me Thanks for my Sermon, and then declared to me what I have atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And now that I may not appear to be a ſingle Witneſs in this Evidence, I ſubjoyn theſe following Atteſtations, firſt that quoted by Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi> p. 10. <hi>That Mrs</hi> Gauden <hi>told a Lady of good Quality, That ſhe had a great concern for the eternal State of her Husband, becauſe he pretended he was the Author of that Book, when to her knowledge he never wrote it.</hi> This Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> had from a Miniſter in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> To this I ſhall ſubjoyn the agreeing Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who lived with Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> and as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> intimates, did Tranſcribe the Book; which Teſtimony I had from the mouth of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Edw.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99534:9"/>wrote nothing of the Truth of which he was not throughly perſwaded by as full Evidence as he judged ſuch a Matter of Fact needed, and at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Time was capable of.</hi> Yet after this ſolemn Appeal, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his Knowledge and Belief, in the ſame Page he begs leave to retain his Opinion, <hi>Till Means of Knowledge, Reaſons of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, Arguments for thinking otherwiſe be produced;</hi> and then promiſeth to yield. So that notwithſtanding his Knowledge and Belief, and his being throughly perſwaded by full Evidence, he is ſtill in a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpence, and doubts that ſuch Arguments may be produced as may alter his Opinion. And in <hi>p.</hi> 3. he talks of ſuch probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may confirm himſelf, and ſatisfie others; among which Arguments, that which he mentioneth <hi>p.</hi> 8. he judgeth to carry the faireſt and higheſt Probability to confirm what he had before declared, <hi>viz. The reaſonable Belief that he,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>was the Compoſer of it.</hi> The Argument is <hi>p.</hi> 8. <hi>n.</hi> 5. in theſe words: <hi>I am as ſure as I can be of any thing, that Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>made the Extract out of this Book called, (I think)</hi> Apophthegmata Carolina; <hi>the thing is most notorious that there was ſuch a Book came out in a very ſhort time after, printed by Mr.</hi> Dugard. <hi>Now why ſhould Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>concern himſelf ſo much more than any other of the King's Friends, and diſpatch it with ſuch Expedition, had he had no more concern in it than other Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Let the Reader judge how probable the reſt of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, when in his own Judgment this is the faireſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Probability to confirm what he hath declared; for what force is there in the Argument, becauſe Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> collected the <hi>Apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegmata Carolina,</hi> therefore he made the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as if the Abbreviating of any Book were an Argument that the Abbreviator were the Author of it. Indeed the very Argument is a ſcandalous Reflection on his Friend's Memory, as if it had not been enough to ſham the World with a Book in the King's Name, but he muſt Extract his own Apothegms, or Wiſe Sayings out of it, and charge his Prince with what he never ſaid, nor thought of: It had been a pretty way of trumpetting his own Praiſe, and ſetting his own Military, Political, and Theological Abilities on a Level with thoſe of the wiſeſt Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> I think Antiquity gives us no Inſtance of any Man publiſhing his own Apothegms; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Dr. <hi>W.</hi>'s unfortunate in this, ſince the Collector and Publiſher of the <hi>Apophthegmata Carolina</hi> was not Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> but Dr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> a Perſon ſtill living in <hi>White-Lion-Court,</hi> againſt <hi>Virginia-ſtreet,</hi> in <hi>Wapping.</hi> It would have concluded more rationally, if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:99534:9"/>had defended it againſt <hi>Milton</hi> and ſome others that wrote againſt it, as Dr. <hi>Earle</hi> did; yet none will infer, that Dr. <hi>Earle</hi> was the Author, though he took the Pains alſo to Tranſlate it into <hi>Latine:</hi> And it's a more Logical Inference to ſay, Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> publiſhed an Extract of weighty Sentences out of that Book, therefore he was not the Author of it. Dr. <hi>Earle</hi>'s Teſtimony given by Mr. <hi>Beck, p.</hi> 28. of Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi> is very convincing, <hi>That he being ſent by his Lord Vicount</hi> Hereford <hi>to Dr.</hi> Earle, <hi>then at the</hi> Hague, <hi>to ask what he knew of the King's being Author of that Book, the Doctor told him,</hi> 
                  <q>As ſure as he knew himſelf to be the Tranſlator of that Book in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Latine,</hi> ſo certain he was King <hi>Charles</hi> was the Author of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>And he adds,</hi> 
                  <q>For my part I am apt to believe no Perſon was able to frame that Book, but a Suffering King, and no Suffering King, but King <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 4. declares what he knew of this Book, and by what means: <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden (ſaith he) <hi>ſometime before the whole was finiſhed, was pleaſed to acquaint me with his Deſign, and ſhewed me the Heads of divers Chapters, and ſome of the Diſcourſes written of them; and after ſome time ſpent in the Peruſal, he vouchſaft to ask my Opinion concerning it; and after ſome Conſideration, I told him, I ſuppoſed it would be much for the King's Reputation, Honour, and Safety,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have another Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s (which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall have at large,) which is dated <hi>March</hi> 23d, 1690, where he declares, That he is uncertain whether he ever read this Book in Manuſcript, or only ſaw it with its Title of the Chapters. Now as the growth of a Teſtimony by material Additions and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is accounted a Prejudice againſt it, ſo much more when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is affirmed in the later which was denied in the former Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; for in <hi>p.</hi> 4. he ſays, He perfectly remembreth, that in the ſecond Chapter of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>He only hath been least vext by them who counſelled me not to conſent againſt the Vote of my own Conſcience;</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> told him, that Dr. <hi>Jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was meant by that Paſſage. Which was common Diſcourſe, ſhortly after the Earl's Death, though Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> makes it a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: There were printed ſome Reflections ſhortly after the Book was publiſhed, and in the Frontiſpiece Bp. <hi>Juxton</hi> deſcribed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Curtain dictating the Book.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Teſtimony concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>March</hi> 23, 1690, was as followeth:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote that whole Book, two Chapters only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99534:10"/>the one about Liturgies, the other of Refuſing the King the Attendance of his Chaplains; which two Chapters were written by Bp. <hi>Duppa:</hi> Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> well remembring that Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> told him, That Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi> upon the Peruſal of this Book, told Bp. <hi>Gauden,</hi> that the two forementioned Heads were fit to be writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore deſired him to draw up two Chapters on the ſame; but after farther Conſideration, he told him, That he would write thoſe two Chapters himſelf. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That conſidering Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Circumſtances, it was very obvious why Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſhould not think of writing on thoſe Heads, becauſe the Doctor diſuſed the Liturgy, and had never been one of the King's Chaplains; and ſo not ſo ſenſible of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on thoſe two Chapters.</p>
                  <p>The bigger part of the Copy of this Book was delivered by Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> to Mr. <hi>Simmons,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> conjectures.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Peacock,</hi> Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Steward's Brother, received part of thoſe Papers from Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> particularly the Picture ſealed up: theſe were put up in a Trunk between the Lady <hi>Warwick</hi>'s Points. <hi>Peacock</hi> delivered theſe Papers to another Perſon unknown to Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Lieutenant <hi>Arraker</hi> ſeized Mr. <hi>Simmons</hi>'s Papers in <hi>Carter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> on a <hi>Sunday,</hi> among which the Proof-ſheets of this Book were, which were reſtored to Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> on <hi>Munday,</hi> by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Col. <hi>Rich,</hi> upon the Interceſſion of Dr. <hi>W.</hi> Some of the Proof-ſheets, having the <hi>Greek</hi> Title on the outward Leaf, were ſcattered in <hi>Carter-lane,</hi> and gathered up by <hi>Simmonds</hi>'s Son, or ſome of the Family, as ſoon as the Troopers were gone.</p>
                  <p>Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> told Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that he delivered a Copy of this Book to the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> when he went to the Treaty at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> and deſired him to deliver it to the King, if he could find an Opportunity, and know his Majeſty's Pleaſure, whether he would give leave that it might be publiſhed; but whether the King did ever receive the Papers, the Biſhop could not tell, he received no account of the ſame, as he told Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> a little before his Death.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> enquired of the Biſhop, how he could ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in impoſing this Book on the World? The Biſhop replyed, <hi>Conſider the Title, being the King's Portraicture, and no Man uſeth to draw his own Picture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> were both privy to theſe Affairs, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99534:10"/>together in the Biſhop's Houſe, though the Doctor is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he ever read this Book in Manuſcript, or only ſaw it with its Title of the Chapters, though he thinks that Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> might Copy it out.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <q>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> diſcourſed Major <hi>Huntington</hi> at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> about the King's Papers, who told him, That he had been under Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation about that Affair before ſeveral Committees of Parliament, and all that ever he ſaid was, That he had ſeen ſeveral Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of the King's whilſt he attended him, which he conjectur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might be thoſe; but never affirmed them to be ſo, becauſe he never read one word of them.</q> Of this Teſtimony we ſhall have occaſion to make uſe hereafter.</p>
               <p>P. 4. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>ſhewed me the Heads, and ſome of the Diſcourſes, and after ſome time ſpent in Peruſal, I expreſly added, I ſtuck at the Lawfulneſs of it; and modeſtly askt him, How he ſatisfied himſelf ſo to impoſe upon the World?</hi> In <hi>p.</hi> 35. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> makes his Apology for diſcovering this Secret, after he had ſuppreſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it for forty Years; and complains how hard meaſure it would be not to ſuffer a Man to reveal that, by concealing of which he fears God is diſpleaſed, and he neceſſitated to labour under a continued Uneaſineſs and Diſſatisfaction of his own Mind: And he confeſſeth, he had many cogent Reaſons to perſuade him that God was not well pleaſed with Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> others, and himſelf, for what we contributed to it. This is well conſidered, but it is very inconſiderately added, what he ſays in a few Lines after, <hi>That he ſuffered this Diſcovery to be wrung and wreſted from him, by ſome Body's impertinent Affectation to meddle with what he underſtood not;</hi> for if he had been really troubled in Conſcience for concealing that Secret, which he there gives for the revealing of it, <hi>i. e. Becauſe as we muſt not ſpeak wickedly for God, nor talk deceitfully for him, neither may we do ſo for any Man.</hi> And as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays, <hi>An officious Lye ought not to be told to ſave the whole World.</hi> And that there was more than Appearance of Pious Fraud in this Affair, which by his Silence he contributed to the maintaining of; a Perſon truly conſciencious would have timely, freely, and ingenuouſly have made the Diſcovery, and not ſuffered the Wound to rankle and diſquiet him for forty Years together, and not ſeek eaſe by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of it till he was forc't to it in his own Defence.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> adds, <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>That he dining ſometime after with Dr.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>he went with him after Dinner to Bp.</hi> Duppa; <hi>and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99534:11"/>Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>having had ſome diſcourſe with the Biſhop, Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>told Dr.</hi> Walker, <hi>That the ſubſtance of their diſcourſe was to this effect: That the Biſhop told Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>there were two Subjects more which he propounded to the Doctor to write on,</hi> (viz) <hi>The Ordinance againſt the Common Prayer, and the denying the Attenaance of his Majeſty's Chaplains; but on ſecond Thoughts the Biſhop deſired the Doctor to leave the writing on thoſe two Heads to him; which accordingly he did, as Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>own'd to Dr.</hi> Walker, <hi>and others who were privy to the whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am fully perſuaded by the little Knowledge that I had of Bp. <hi>Duppa,</hi> that all the Art that Bp. <hi>Gauden</hi> had, could never have drawn Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi> to conſent with, and aſſiſt him in what Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> accounts a Pious Fraud, more than appearance of Evil; the very concealing of which was a Trouble to Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence forty Years together; or if he had done ſuch a thing, he would have hazarded his Majeſty's Favour, whoſe Judgment was, as he declares, in the laſt of his Meditations, on the Reformation of the Times, <hi>That as good Ends cannot juſtifie evil Means, ſo nor will evil Beginning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s ever bring forth good Concluſions.</hi> And if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> had written that Period, he had been Self condemned, as well as by the Apoſtle thoſe are who ſay, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if others (how many Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſaith not, and perhaps he might not know all that) were privy to the whole, it is probable ſome of them before their Deaths might have revealed this Secret, or if any of them were living would have been produced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Doctor's Teſtimony, but we muſt take all on his word: Though if Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi> had written on thoſe two Heads, there might be ſome difference obſerved in the Stile; which appears to Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> himſelf to be exactly of the ſame Thread; and hugely differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both from the Biſhop's and the Doctor's manner of writing, as will appear hereafter. But the reaſon which he gives why it was unlikely that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> neither thought nor wrote on theſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſeems very infirm, <hi>p.</hi> 7. he ſays, <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>was leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think on them.</hi> What? leſs than to think of writing on the Covenant; which Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays he had taken, <hi>p.</hi> 7. and againſt which not long after he wrote a large Treatiſe. Or was he leſs concern'd to write of the <hi>Common Preyer Book,</hi> which was made the Apple of Contention? eſpecially when that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> obſerves a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 7. That when Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> diſcover'd his Error he endeavoured to redeem it by an <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by bending to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99534:11"/>the contrary Extream. Or was he leſs concern'd to write of the neceſſary Uſefulneſs of his Majeſty's Chaplains in his great Diſtreſs, when the Doctor himſelf had the Attendance of two ſuch as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gifford?</hi> Doubtleſs the Doctor could not but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it to be a moſt Unchriſtian Rigor, to have the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Spiritual Monitors and Comforters denied to him when he was in Extremity, and appointed as a Sheep for the Slaughter: Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> knew better, and was more concerned to write on this Subject, than to give Rules to the Prince how to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 5. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> asking Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Whether the King had ever ſeen the Book? Anſwered, <hi>I know it certainly no more than you, but I ſent a Copy of it by the Marqueſs of</hi> Hartford, <hi>when he went to the</hi> Iſle of Wight, <hi>intreating him on a private Opportunity to deliver it to his Majeſty, and humbly deſire to know his Majeſty's Pleaſure concerning it; but the Violence which threatned the King haſtning ſo faſt, he ventured to print it, and never knew what was the Iſſue of ſending it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It looks very odly, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> having committed ſo great a Buſineſs to the Marqueſs's Management, ſhould never (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Opportunities after his return from the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi>) enquire, Whether the King had ſeen the Book, and how he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Deſign? And no leſs ſtrange, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſhould preſume to print ſuch a Volume in the King's Name, and make ſuch Appeals and Proteſtations as if he had been made his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Proxy, and were authorized, <hi>Jurare in Animam ſuam.</hi> And what great Hopes could the Doctor conceive, that the publiſhing of the Book could ſtop the current of Violence which threatned the King, when it had born down all the Mediation uſed by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Ambaſſadors, all the Oppoſition made by the then Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment voting his Majeſty's Conceſſions a ſufficient Ground for a Treaty of Peace, the many Inſurrections and Revolts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Land, and of the Navy by Sea, and the <hi>Scots</hi> Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Arming on his Majeſty's behalf? What hopes, I ſay, could Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> conceive that his Book ſhould be a Charm ſufficient to calm that impetuous Torrent, which grew the more rapid for all thoſe Oppoſitions? This, and the Doctor's Neglect to enquire of the Marqueſs, whether the King did approve of the Pious Fraud, may induce the conſidering Reader to believe, that the Doctor did not convey any ſuch Book of his to his Majeſty by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, for which we have no Evidence beſides Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s bare
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99534:12"/>Word: and in the firſt Teſtimony Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had no account of it a little before his Death. Tho' the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and the Doctor lived ſomewhile after the Reſtauration. And Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> being askt, Whether K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second knew that he wrote the Book? anſwer'd, That he could not certainly ſay he did, becauſe he never took notice of it to him; but he took it for granted, becauſe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> knew it, and ſpake of it to him, and owned it as a ſeaſonable and acceptable Service; and he knowing it, I queſtion not but the King doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> For all this we have only Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s bare Word, and that imports not that the King knew it, but upon a Preſumption that the Duke did. Now to this Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> replies, <hi>p.</hi> 4. It is ſtrange that if the King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second knew of it, and the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and Bp. <hi>Duppa,</hi> who could have informed the King of the great Merit of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> in writing and publiſhing that Book, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſhould have no Preferment but the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of <hi>Exeter</hi> for the preſent; and that when (as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays,) he had a Promiſe of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> he failed of it. And as Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſays, The King ſeemed averſe from giving it to him; which was to fail of his Word. And as Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> confeſſeth, he was not certain that the King knew of it, a little before his Tranſlation from <hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Worceſter:</hi> I ſay it is ſtrange, that the King ſhould deny him any Kindneſs, eſpecially that which he had promiſed, when he gave Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and offered others to Perſons that had deſerved Rewards of another kind.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>That Mrs.</hi> Gauden, <hi>his Wife, Mr.</hi> Gifford, <hi>who he thinks tranſcribed a Copy of it, and himſelf, believed it, as much as they could any Matter of Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> As to Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> I have had a Report, (as from Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi>) That ſhe being interrogated on the Sacrament, <hi>Whether her Husband was the Author of this Book?</hi> She declared upon her taking the Sacrament, <hi>That he told her that he was.</hi> This is confronted by Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> p. 10. who was aſſured by a Reverend and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miniſter in <hi>London,</hi> that a Lady of good Quality told him, <hi>That ſhe being in company with Mrs.</hi> Gauden, <hi>ſhe told her, That ſhe had a great concern for the eternal State of her Husband, becauſe he pretended to be the Author of that Book, when to her knowledge he never writ it.</hi> Both theſe Teſtimonies cannot be true, if Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſpake them; and this makes me think one of them was Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s; for this is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99534:12"/>ſo material a Proof, that if Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> knew the truth of it, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why he omitted it in his printed Book; it is a ſhrewd Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption againſt a Witneſs, when he ſo varieth in his Teſtimony, as to add a material Evidence at one time, and to omit another at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time; when a Perſon is unconſtant and inconſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelf in a Matter of great importance, it is an Argument of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs. Again, by this Solemnity of Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Husband to be the Author of that Book, upon her taking the Sacrament, the Intent ſeems to be, that this Secret might be laid open, and made notorious; and to that end that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants were made acquainted with it, and if it were at a publick Sacrament, there was likely a full Congregation, if it were a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sacrament, deſired by Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> for the Eaſe of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, (as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> found the concealing it to be a Trouble to his,) yet we ſuppoſe there muſt be at leaſt three Communicants by whoſe Teſtimony Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Declaration might be confirmed, and the Notoriety of the thing be perpetuated: How comes it to paſs after all this, the thing ſhould remain a Secret ſtill, and not known (for ought we yet hear of,) to any one but Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> whom Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſuppoſeth to have been the Tranſcriber of the Copy, and to have believed it as much as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I have oppoſed the Teſtimony of Dr. <hi>Edw. Lake,</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Exeter,</hi> wno was well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> and his ſingle Teſtimony far more Credible than Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> delivered to him what was laſt ſent up, giving ſtrict Caution with what Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to carry and deliver it;<note place="margin">See his Account of <hi>March 23d, 1690.</hi>
                  </note> and accordingly he delivered it, <hi>Saturday, December</hi> 23d, 48, to one <hi>Peacock,</hi> who was inſtructed by what Hands to tranſmit it to Mr. <hi>Royſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the Doctor ſays, to ſhew his great Care to diſcharge his Truſt; who notwithſtanding the ſtrict Caution with what Wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to carry and deliver it, he committed it to one <hi>Peacock,</hi> a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Bailiff, with new Inſtructions by what other Hands he ſhould tranſmit it to Mr. <hi>Roſton;</hi> whereas he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth that the bigger part of this Book was delivered by Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to Mr. <hi>Simmonds.</hi> He wanted a good Memory, as he ſays of Dr. <hi>Hollingworth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reader cannot but obſerve, that in all this tedious Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, he meets with no other Evidence but Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s bare Word,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99534:13"/>which will not amount to a ſingle Teſtimony, being invalidated by his own Relation of Matters of Fact, very inconſiſtent with each other, and unſatisfactory to himſelf, and wanting a further Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, is forced to find out probable Reaſons, ſuch as they be in,</p>
               <p>SECT. III. <hi>Of his probable Arguments to Confirm himſelf, and help to Convince others,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The firſt probable Argument is, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Long Parliament, which carried on the War against the King, preacht before them on</hi> Zach. 8.19. <hi>which Sermon is printed; and the Houſe of Commons preſented him with a large Silver Tankard, with this Inſcription,</hi> Donum Honorarium Populi Anglicani in Parliamento congregati Johanni Gauden, &amp;c. <hi>which conſtantly went about his Houſe; and he had been inclinable to the Parliament Interest, till he found they went beyond their first Pretentions, and the Expectations of himſelf and other good Men: When he diſcover'd that, he endeavoured to redeem his Error by bending to the contrary Extream. And I am perſuaded it was this that put him on the deſigning and finiſhing of this Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is ſo far from being probable, and fit for Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that it is more like to move Laughter, for it may conclude thus for Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> as well as for Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> had been of the Parliament Party againſt the King, was a Favourite of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a Chaplain to them, but when they went beyond his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, he bended to the contrary Extream, therefore Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> wrote the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But though the Argument doth not make this probable, yet it ſhews a great Probability, that Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> hath bended to contrary Extreams; but Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> is more conſtant to his firſt Principles.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s ſecond probable Argument is drawn from the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the Covenant; and <hi>p.</hi> 6. he relates it at large to this effect: <hi>That being privy to the truth of this Affair, out of Curioſity he asked Dr.</hi> Barwick, <hi>Dean of St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, What he thought of this Book? for the thing being doubtfully ſpoken of, he made bold to ask his Judgment of it.</hi> The Dean preſſed him with this Argument, <hi>If it were written by any but the King, it must be a Friend, or an Enemy; not by an Enemy, for no Enemy of the King would have repreſented him ſo much to his Advantage; not by a Friend, for no Friend of his would write as he doth of the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. Meaning ſo favourably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It is highly improbable that Dr. <hi>Barwick,</hi> who doubtleſs had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99534:13"/>conſidered that Chapter againſt the Covenant, would have choſen ſuch an Argument, when there is as much ſaid in that Chapter to condemn the Covenant, as could rationally be expected; for in the firſt Paragraph he ſays, That <hi>it was a pawning of their Souls to the Presbyterian</hi> Scots <hi>by a Solemn League and Covenant.</hi> In the ſecond he calls it, <hi>An Engine intended chiefly to batter down Epiſcopacy;</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to a Charm and Exorciſm. In the third, That <hi>it contained many dubious and dangerous Limitations;</hi> referring to himſelf, <hi>and things very diſputable, which could not be ſworn to with Judgment and Certainty to a Man's ſelf, or Charity and Candor to others.</hi> P. 4. That <hi>impoſing Oaths on People muſt needs in things doubtful be dangerous, and in things unlawful</hi> (as he had proved this to be by his Proclamation, and the irrefragrable Arguments of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd,) <hi>was damnable.</hi> P. 5. That <hi>it was not only ſuperfluous, but irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable to former Oaths, and the Proteſtation ſo lately taken to maintain the Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>ſince they account Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline ſo great a part of Religion.</hi> P. 6. That <hi>it was laid as a Snare and Engine by Men of ambitious Minds to catch and hold vulgar Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, under the Terror of Perjury.</hi> P. 7. That <hi>ſuch After-contracts impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without and againſt the King's Conſent, or any Power or Preſident from the Laws of God or Man, could not abſolve the Subjects from thoſe Moral Bonds of Duty which lay on their Conſciences both to God and the King; and calls it a mocking of God.</hi> Now what Friend of the King's need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reflect more ſeverely upon the Covenant, than the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath done? I can therefore hardly think that Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> would uſe this as an Argument that it was written by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe no Friend of his would have written ſo favourably of it. It rather ſeems a contrived Argument of one that would ſolve his own Hypotheſis: That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote that Book, becauſe in the Chapter of the Covenant there are ſome things ſpoken in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it, which beſt became Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> who ſpeaks the more favourably becauſe he had taken it, than any of the King's Friends or himſelf would have done. That which ſeems moſt in favour of the Covenant, is this: <hi>That the Impoſers of it were content to make it like Manna (not that it came from Heaven as Manna did,) agreeable to every Man's palate who would ſwallow it; they admit any Man's ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, though divers or contrary, with any Salvo's, Cautions, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, ſo as they croſs not their chief Deſign laid against the Church and me; (i. e.)</hi> the King. Now this is as ſharp a Reprimand as could be conceived, where the King ſhews how the Covenanters
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99534:14"/>mocked God by Salvo's, Cautions, and Reſervations, uſed as Baits to draw the People into their Snares; he was far enough from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving ſuch ſhuſting Cautions in a Solemn Covenant which was to be taken in Judgment, in Truth, and in Righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.2. The King adds, That <hi>in ſuch Latitudes of Sences, he believes many that loved Him and the Church, might take the Covenant, who were not ſo taken by it as to act clearly against both Piety and Loyalty; and that many yielded to it more to prevent imminent Violence and Ruine, which in caſe of dental hung over their heads, than for any Value of it, or Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it.</hi> He adds, <hi>That the Latitude of ſome general Clauſes may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſerve ſomewhat to relieve them, as of doing and endeavouring what lawfully they may in their Places and Callings, and according to the Word of God, for theſe carry no Man beyond thoſe Bounds of good Conſcience, which are certain and fixed either to God's Laws, as to the general, or the Laws of the Kingdom as to the particular Exerciſe of Mens Duties.</hi> And therefore he <hi>deſires ſuch as glory most in the Name of Covenanters, to keep themſelves within thoſe lawful Bounds.</hi> In all which there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſuch Charity and Prudent and Pious Advice as becomes the beſt of Kings: And therefore the mature Conſideration of this Chapter is a more propable Argument that it was penned by the King rather than by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> or any other, who could not add as the King doth, <hi>I willingly forgive ſuch Mens taking the Covenant, who keep within ſuch Bounds of Piety, Law, and Loyalty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Diſcourſe which he pretends to have had with Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> who he ſays was his Tutor, gave him a fair Opportunity (if the concealing of his Secret had been a real Trouble to him,) to acquaint his Tutor, <hi>as he voluntarily offered to inform the Archbiſhop</hi> Sandcroft, how much he and the World were deceived, as to the Author of that Book, whom he knew to be Bp. <hi>Gauden;</hi> and that his handling the Covenant ſo gently, was becauſe he had taken the Covenant. But this probable Argument might have been turned to a plain Confutation of his Fiction, from what is repeated out of that Chapter; which without doubt Dr. <hi>Barwick</hi> had read and conſidered better, than to conclude that it ſpoke in favour of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The Doctor's third probable Argumentis as the former, his ſingle Affirmation, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>told him, that Bp.</hi> Duppa <hi>wrote the two Chapters concerning the Liturgy and Chaplains; and his free decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that he neither thought nor wrote of theſe Subjects; and that</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays) <hi>it was unlikely he ſhould, renders it very probable he ſpake the truth in declaring that he wrote the rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99534:14"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the King had great reaſon both to think and write of thoſe Subjects, is very obvious; and as evident, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> had more reaſon to think and write of them then of ſeveral other Heads, particularly that which reflects ſo much on his Reputation, having been a Covenanter; and that other of preſcribing Rules to the Prince for the Government of his Kingdoms. But of this I have ſaid enough before; I only add, It was very improper to call the Prince his Son, and the Queen his Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth probable Argument is, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Walker <hi>met with Expreſſions in the Devotional Part, very frequently uſed by Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>in his Prayers; which he never heard from any other Man, and most Men in their Prayers eſpecially have peculiar Phraſes and Modes of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves: And where ſuch occur, 'tis a probable Evidence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from him to whom they were peculiar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I wiſh the Doctor had given us ſome of thoſe Phraſes and Modes; I have compared the Stile and ſeveral Expreſſions of the Doctor's in a Treatiſe of his, which the Reader ſhall find hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as much differing from the Phraſes and Expreſſions in the King's Book, as the Waters of <hi>Siloah,</hi> which go ſoftly, from the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Falls of <hi>Nile,</hi> which keep within no Bounds, and abound with Mud and Monſters: The King's Expreſſions are moſtly in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-phraſe, which though other Men do uſe, yet few do apply more pertinently and affectionately; and what Meditations are properly his own, few Men of his Age could imitate, for the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Stile: And Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> is as far from it as moſt Writers of that Age. But to talk of peculiar Expreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not to give one Inſtance, is but to beat the Air.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument concerning the <hi>Apophthegmata Carolina</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready anſwered; now when all theſe five probable Arguments are (as he ſays) joyned together, and the Reader hath conſidered that they are only Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Affirmations, they will rather conclude that his Knowledge was very imperfect that needed ſuch Proofs to confirm it, which as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> acknowledgeth, do more harm than good. And I think that no Impartial Reader will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by them; for if, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, that believing or not believing depends upon the Clearneſs or Cogency of the Motives of Credibility, or the Weakneſs and Inſufficiency of them, no Man will build his Belief on ſuch a ſandy Foundation: <hi>And,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> ſays, <hi>we may ſuppoſe that Houſe is likely to fall that is ſupported by ſuch Props.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99534:15"/>The Teſtimony which I mentioned before, Dr. <hi>Charles Goodal</hi> aſſures me he had from Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s own mouth, <hi>March</hi> 23d, 1690, and it requires a few Remarks, As firſt, where it ſays, that the bigger part of the Book was delivered by Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to Mr. <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Remark</hi> 1. Then Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> and Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> were no ſuch Strangers (as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> repreſents them,) when the Book was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the Preſs, and probably Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> well knew who the Author was, and whatever Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> did, Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> would not have conſented to the publiſhing of it in the King's Name, if it were Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s; for if the Fraud had been found out, it would have more diſparaged the King and his Cauſe, than the concealing of it could have advantaged it; the King's great Abilities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency being better known and believed than to need ſuch Props and Fallacious Means to ſupport it, which I believe his pious Soul would have abhorred, if it had been propoſed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem.</hi> 2. If the bigger part of the Book was delivered by Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> that delivery might be only a return of what the Doctor had received before from Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> for he was chiefly intruſted with the printing of it, as appears by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of the Proof-ſheets to him to Correct them; and if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> had been the Author, he had better means to ſend it to the Preſs, and was more fit to correct his own Copy, than to commit this Work, and the Secret of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s being the Author of it, to a Sequeſtred Man, who as the Event ſhews, was ſuſpected, and hardly eſcaped a full Diſcovery, whereas both Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> were Favourites of the Times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem.</hi> 3. Whereas he ſays, that he and Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> who both li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Houſe, knew this Secret; I have ſhewn that Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> was of a contrary Perſwaſion to that of Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s, for Mr. <hi>Gifford</hi> ſpake of it, and quoted it in his Sermon as the King's Book, and he being the Tranſcriber of it, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> intimates, had more opportunity and means to inform himſelf who was the Author.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem.</hi> 4. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, He was uncertain whether he ever read the Book in Manuſcript, but only ſaw it with the Titles of the Chapters. This is contrary to what he had more than once affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he had read it, and particularly that Chapter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Earl of <hi>Strafford;</hi> whereupon he diſcourſed with Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and queſtioned, How he could ſatisfie himſelf to impoſe ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99534:15"/>a Book on the World in the King's Name? <hi>P.</hi> 4. He ſays, <hi>Dr.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>ſhewed me the Heads of divers Chapters, and ſome of the Diſcourſes written of them, and after ſometime ſpent in the Peruſal, he askt my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of it;</hi> which amounts to a Contradiction, ſcarcely to be excus'd by the Uncertainty of his Memory: But if he never read the Book in Manuſcript, how could he be ſo certain that the Book was of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Compiling? And indeed the Intenion of doing the King Service by ſuch an Impoſture, was in Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſuch a Sin as the making of a Practical Lye, and in Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> who conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and by Silence gave Conſent, a making himſelf a Party, which Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> from St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> condemns as a thing not to be practiſed for the ſaving of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rem.</hi> 5. Whereas Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> being asked, How he could ſatisfie himſelf in writing ſuch a Book in the King's Name? That he replied, <hi>Look on the Title;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>no Man u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to draw his own Picture.</hi> This is overthrown by Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi>'s Teſtimony, <hi>p.</hi> 4. of Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi> where it is affirmed, That Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> ſhewed the firſt Proof-ſheet to Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> the Title whereof was, <hi>The Royal Plea,</hi> which the Doctor ſaid would betray the Book, there being two Informers, <hi>Cheltenham</hi> and <hi>Jones,</hi> who would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Book by the Title, and therefore Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> wrote to the King to have it changed, and had leave to call it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which thoſe Informers could not underſtand being <hi>Greek.</hi> This Teſtimony concerning the Title, ſeems more rational than that which Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> reports from Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> who, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, would excuſe himſelf for impoſing his Book on the World as if it were the King's, becauſe no Man uſeth to draw his own Picture. When I conſider Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s ſubjoyning theſe probable Arguments to confirm his poſitive Aſſertion, and to convince his Reader; it minded me of the frequent Salvo's uſed by our News-writers, who having related a fictitious Story to fill up their Papers, are wont to add, <hi>But this needs a Confirmation;</hi> and then 'tis an hundred to one but they have made a falſe Relation. When we ſee a Man conſtantly uſing Crutches, we conclude he is an infirm Perſon; and we may gueſs at the ſtrength of the Doctor's Perſwaſion and Affirmation by the Cogency of his probable Arguments.</p>
               <p>So that if this Relation was taken from Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s own mouth, as Dr. <hi>Goodal</hi> aſſures me, and I am induced to believe, becauſe Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 34. That he had occaſionally, and when he had been deſired, declared the Subſtance of what he now
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99534:16"/>hath written. And I have been credibly informed, That Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> had often ſpoken too freely of this Affair in Coffe-houſes and to ſeveral Companies, not without much Variation in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from what he ſays he is now forced to write; and it hath been obſerved, that ſome Men have ſo long divulged their own Fancies, that at laſt they have believed them to be true; and to ſave their Reputation from being accounted vain Perſons, are ready to ſwear to what they have ſaid: In which I wiſh the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could find cauſe to excuſe the Doctor, and believe that what he hath reported is a true Story, and not a ſtrong Imagination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he teſtifieth of himſelf, That it is both naturally and morally next to impoſſible that it ſhould be ſo, <hi>p.</hi> 17. to which he would perſwade his Reader, becauſe his Story is ſo ſelf-conſiſtent in all its parts; which he ſays the <hi>Aldgate Doctor's</hi> is not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I think it as poſſible for Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to tell a falſe Story af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another Man, as for Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> and ſeeing they relate ſuch different Stories as cannot both be true, it is more likely that he that grounds his Confidence on the Relation of a ſingle Perſon, and tells the Story with many Imperfections, Inconſiſtencies, and Contradictions, though he make his Appeals to God for the Truth of it, as too many do in every Court, ſhould be adjudged to tell an Untruth, rather than he who proves the Veracity of his Relation by a much more conſiderable number of Men of good Reputation, than the Laws of God or Man require for the ending of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies. And whereas he complains, <hi>p.</hi> 35. <hi>That it is hard meaſure not to ſuffer a Man to reveal that, by concealing which he fears God is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſed, and he neceſſitated to labour under a continued Diſſatisfaction of Mind.</hi> I wonder what Neceſſity forced him againſt his mind to conceal this Secret, when he being a Chaplain at <hi>Warwick-houſe,</hi> was under a great Temptation of being highly preferred by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, if at that time he had freely diſcovered it, and therewithal eaſed his Conſcience from that which kept him uneaſie forty Years together. He concludes after all his confident Affirmations and probable Arguments, as a Sceptick, <hi>p.</hi> 37. <hi>If any Man can produce ſtronger Reaſons for the Negative part, I do not ſay only I will, but that I must believe that contrary part.</hi> How vainly therefore doth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him that ſhall write againſt him to write nothing for the Truth of which he doth not make the like Appeals to God which he hath done, which I think no good Man will do upon ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Hearſays and probable Arguments, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> makes his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99534:16"/>Appeals; from doing whereof the Advertiſement of the Printer may be a Diſcouragement, <hi>(viz.) That the Author coming to</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>to publiſh this Treatiſe, it pleaſed God before it was finiſhed at the Preſs, to take him to himſelf.</hi> However, this Point we have gained by Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Conceſſion, <hi>That if any Man can produce more prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments for the contrary Opinion, he must be of that Perſwaſion,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſaid he would and muſt.

Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi> ſays, <hi>Some Men have with Induſtry endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſwade the World, that the Book was a Forgery, and not of the King's Compiling;</hi> and names the <hi>Eſſex Doctor.</hi> This Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> the <hi>Eſſex Doctor,</hi> ſays, is an unlucky Omen, to ſtumble ſo at the Threſhold, becauſe he calls it an Objection againſt the King.</p>

                  <hi>Reply.</hi> If the writing of the Book gained great Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the King, then thoſe Objectors that denied the King to be the Author, did ſcandalouſly reflect upon his Majeſty: Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> grants the Antecedent, and therefore the Concluſion will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10. Dr. <hi>Hollingworth, I could not believe that any Man could write at that Divine rate, but he that felt the Miſeries which ſuggest ſuch Thoughts and Heavenly Meditations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> inſtead of an Anſwer, ſays only, That this is borow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Sir <hi>W. Dugdale,</hi> who agreed in the ſame Sentiment with Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>The unlikelihood that any ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions could flow from a Heart not oppreſſed and grieved with ſuch a weight of Sorrow as his was,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I believe that moſt judicious Perſons do herein agree with Dr. <hi>H.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. D.</hi> And Dr. <hi>W.</hi> grants it <hi>p.</hi> 11. That <hi>our Affections are kindied by our preſent Circumſtances, and ſurpriſing Mercies or Calamities are Springs of ſuch Joy or Sorrow as ſharpen or ſet an edge on our Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and inſtil ſuch an Air, Energy, and ſutable Eloquence, which the ſame Perſon could not reach at another time.</hi> Dr. <hi>Earle</hi> agreed with Sir <hi>W. Dugdale,</hi> That no afflicted prince, but K. <hi>Charles</hi> could pen ſuch Meditations.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker, When a Man deſigns to perſonate another, he adapts his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99534:17"/>Words and Expreſſions with ſecond and third Thoughts, takes a great deal of Pains, uſeth a ſtudious Induſtry to fit every Thought to ſuch a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every Affection to ſuch a Thought, and every Expreſſion to be a lively</hi>

                  <hi>of ſuch a Paſion or Affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now ſuppoſing that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> wrote that Book, he uſed a ſtudious Induſtry to imitate the King's uſual Words and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo that in Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Opinion the King had a very excellent Train of Thoughts, and fit Words to expreſs them, not to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated without ſecond and third Thoughts, and great Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. And whoever ſhall diligently compare the King's undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Writings with thoſe of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s, will be fully convinced that neither for the Excellency of Thoughts or Elegancy of expreſſing them, the Doctor hath in any meaſure imitated the Stile of the King's Book; in which, as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 12. the Evenneſs of the Thought and Expreſſion, that Equality of the Stile and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the ſame Thread running quite through from firſt to laſt, may perſuade the Reader that it was not compiled by two ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Men as Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi> and Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> but by that Great King, of whom Dr. <hi>W.</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 1. That <hi>his Honour is ſecured by his acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Wiſdom, celebrated Vertues, exemplary Patience, and Chriſtian Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity in his Sufferings.</hi> Now for Dr. <hi>W.</hi> to infer from the King's Sufferings, that he was not the Author of that Book, becauſe the Hurry of Miſeries which attended him, (as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> thinks) muſt diſtract and alter the Temper of his Mind, is an irreparable Injury to the Memory of that Good King, who as he was obſerved to be of an equal Temper of Mind, under various Conditions, ſo his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings gave him Opportunity and Vacancy for ſedate and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Thoughts: And (as the King acknowledged) occaſion'd great Improvement both of his Parts and Pious Devotions; which all that knew him could teſtifie, neither his Victories nor his Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws could at any time cauſe him to intermit. Of which we have this remarkable Inſtance, That twenty Years before his death, the News of the Aſſaſſination of his great Favourite the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> being brought him while he was at Prayer, he took no other notice of it, than to apply himſelf more earneſtly to his Devotions. Nor was he more diſturbed at that ugly Sentence for his death: And when the Commiſſioners at the Treaty in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> inſiſted on their Unreaſonable Demands, he told them, <hi>He could with more comfort cast himſelf on his Saviour's Goodneſs to ſupport and defend him from all Afflictions that might befal him, rather then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99534:17"/>for any Politick Conſiderations which might ſeem to be a Means of reſtoring him, to deprive himſelf of the Tranquility of his Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 13. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> objects againſt Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> that he ſaith in that Page, That the Book was ſent by a truſty Meſſenger to Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> from the King.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>This Dr.</hi> W. <hi>confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> March 23, 1690.</note> But <hi>p.</hi> 39. That he deſired Bp. <hi>Juxon</hi> to get ſome tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Friend to look it over, and put it into exact Order: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he inſults over Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> as having a bad Memory, and publiſhing things inconſiſtent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas he that ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> diſtinguiſheth the time, <hi>viz. That in the Year</hi> 1647, <hi>the King ſent the most conſiderable part of his Book, which was in looſe Papers, to Bp.</hi> Juxton <hi>to get it put into good Order; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop ſent it to Sir</hi> J. Brttle<hi>'s Father, who having digeſted and tranſcribed it, was conveyed back to the King; and being perfected by the addition of more Chapters, and made ready for the Preſs in the Year</hi> 48, <hi>was ſent to Mr.</hi> Simmonds <hi>to publiſh it.</hi> Theſe Relations agree ſo well, and Sir <hi>J. Brattle</hi>'s Teſtimony was ſo authentick, that Dr. <hi>W.</hi> was well aware it would be too hot for his Fingers.</p>
               <p>It is highly probable that more Copies than one were tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed from the Original written by the King's hand, 1. Becauſe of the great Eſteem the King had for it. 2. The great Fear leſt one or two Copies might fall into the hands of his Enemies, as his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet did at <hi>Naſeby.</hi> 3. Becauſe the King was adding to or alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome parts in the Original a little before his cloſe Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have ſhewed Reaſons to induce the Reader to believe that, Dr. <hi>Symonds</hi> had a perfect Copy by which it was printed, and by it he was enabled to correct the Proof-ſheets: And it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> might cauſe a Copy of this to be tranſcribed by Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> thinks. Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> declares, That the King for fear the Original ſhould be loſt, ordered Mr. <hi>Odert,</hi> Secretary to Sir <hi>Edw. Nicholas,</hi> Principal Secretary of State, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it, and lodged the Original in the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford</hi>'s hands. And by the Copy of Mr. <hi>Odert</hi> he <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> and Mr. <hi>Milbourne</hi> did print the Book. And further he ſaith, That he never heard, nay, that he was ſure that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that Book by which Mr. <hi>Milbourne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it: And Mr. <hi>milbourne</hi> the Printer, and Mr. <hi>Clifford</hi> who were concerned in the printing of it, ſay, That the Copy by which it was printed came to his hands all at once.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 23. Is an Anſwer to a Treatiſe intituled, <hi>Reſtitution to the Royal Author,</hi> wherein is ſet down this <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the E. of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> on a printed Copy of the King's Book: <hi>K.</hi> Charles <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>did both</hi> (<hi>in the last Seſſions of Parliament</hi> 1675, <hi>when I ſhewed them, in the Lord's Houſe, the written Copy of this Book, wherein are ſome Corrections and Alterations, written with the late K.</hi> Charles <hi>the First's own hand,</hi>) <hi>aſſure me, that this was none of the ſaid King's Compiling, but made by</hi> Dr. <hi>Gauden, Biſhop of</hi> Exon; <hi>which I here inſert for the Undeceiving others in this Point, by atteſting ſo much under my Hand,</hi> Angleſey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whether the whole, or any part of this <hi>Memorandum</hi> were the Hand writing of the E. of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> is not proved, and therefore the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> might more freely reflect on it, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it not to be the Earl's; and that, Firſt, by the Impropriety of the Expreſſions, as calling his then <hi>Royal Highneſs,</hi> which was the proper Court-phraſe (<hi>the D. of</hi> York;) but what is more material, is that both the King and Duke ſhould aſſure him, That this was none of K. <hi>C.</hi> 1ſt's Compiling, but made by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which is a greater Impropriety to call him that dyed Bp. of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> Bp. of <hi>Exeter;</hi> which <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d muſt needs know, having had ſo great a Conteſt with him when he granted him the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who had a Promiſe of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> of which Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> gives a large account, <hi>p.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18. And whereas the Earl ſays, they both did aſſure him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Quere what Arguments they uſed; Dr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelf would not have taken their bare Words for an Aſſurance, ſeeing that he ſtill reſerved a liberty to diſſent from what he ſays, <hi>He was ſo well perſwaded of, as of any matter of Fact, if more probable Arguments were produced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But againſt the bare Word of this Royal Pair, the Author ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the publick Acts of <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d, who <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, gave Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> (as a Requital of printing his Father's Book,) the ſole Priviledge of printing all the Works of K. <hi>C.</hi> 1ſt, among which this Book hath a particular Character of Recommendation; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Priviledge is in theſe words, Charles <hi>the Second,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>whereas we have received ſufficient Teſtimony of the Fidelity and Loyalty of our Servant</hi> Richard Royſton, <hi>and of the great Loſſes and Troubles he ſuſtained for his Faithfulneſs to our Royal Father of Bleſſed Memory, and Our ſelf, in printing and publiſhing many Meſſages and Papers of our ſaid Bleſſed Father, eſpecially thoſe most excellent Diſcourſes and Soliloquies by the Name of</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>Know ye, that it is our Royal Will and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99534:18"/>Pleaſure, and we do by theſe Preſents grant to the ſaid</hi> Richard Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, <hi>&amp;c. the ſole printing and publiſhing of the ſaid Meſſages, Papers, and Diſcourſes contained in the Book intituled,</hi> Reliqiuae Sacrae Carolinae, <hi>with other Papers and Declarations concerning our ſaid Royal Father</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſame Priviledge was granted to Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> by K. <hi>James</hi> the Second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1685, whence the Author of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> leaves it to the Readers to judge, whether theſe publick Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of both the Kings, made with all the Circumſtance of Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, are to be believed before a blind Manuſcript written by a doubtful Hand, and grounded on a private Relation, to which may be added, that K. <hi>James</hi> the Second in a Letter from <hi>Rocheſter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Departure, quoted a Paſſage out of his Father's Book, <hi>viz. There is but little between the Priſons and the Graves of Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Dr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers, That Kings are not ſo Critical as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Particulars of their Royal Grants.</p>
               <p>To which it may be replied, That if they had been well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that this Book was written by Bp. <hi>Gauden,</hi> (as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum ſays they did affirm,) it was a Crime, <hi>Laeſae Majeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> to ſay they publickly and perſonally atteſted that to be their Father's, when they believed the contrary.</p>
               <p>To this Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> rejoyns an Anſwer by a Parallel Caſe, <hi>Of a Printer's having a Licenſe to print K.</hi> David<hi>'s Pſalms, containing in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 150; <hi>Would this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prove that</hi> David <hi>was the Pen-man of them all? No, ſay I, becauſe the Titles prefixt to many of the Pſams de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that ſome of them were penned by other Authors, as</hi> Moſes <hi>who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved long before</hi> David, Heman, Aſaph, <hi>&amp;c. who lived after him; and yet the Denomination may be taken from the greater part of the Pſalms, which are acknowledged to be</hi> David<hi>'s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how could that King give a Priviledge to print his Father's Works, if he knew that the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is eſpecially recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and for the ſake of which the Collection was made, were not his Father's? But as if this Objection had been foreſeen, it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted by the Diſtinction made by both the Kings, between the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which they own to be their Royal Father's, <hi>and other Papers and Declarations concerning their Royal Father;</hi> for the drawing up of which, they conceived he made uſe of his Miniſters and Secretaries, though it be well-known, that his Majeſty of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Memory, was wont not only with great Deliberation to review the firſt Draughts, but taking his Pen in hand, to tell them merily, <hi>That he was a pretty good Cobler;</hi> and made ſuch Additions and Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99534:19"/>as he thought fit; inſomuch as they who knew him moſt intimately, affirmed, That if he had been a Secretary to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince, he would have been eſteemed as an Oracle.</p>
               <p>But here it may be enquired, How the two Kings were ſo well aſſured themſelves, that the Book was written by Bp. <hi>Gauden,</hi> as to aſſure others of it? Whereas Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf knew not to his dying day, whether <hi>Charles</hi> the Second ever knew it, but by Conjecture, becauſe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> knew it. It ſeems then the King muſt have the certainty from the Duke; and he that conſiders the Circumſtances in which the Duke was, and what Dependance for Certainty might be grounded on his ſolemn Words, eſpecially when the Cauſe of his eſpouſed Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was interpoſed, will not be eaſily perſuaded, <hi>Jurare in verba;</hi> It is too evident how little he regarded either the Reputation or the Deſire and Charge of his dying Father, <hi>p.</hi> 138. of that Book, <hi>viz. I intreat and require you, as your Father and King, That you never ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your Heart to receive the least Check against, or Diſaffection from the true Religion eſtabliſhed in the Church of</hi> England, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Author of the <hi>Reſtitution</hi> urgeth a more conſiderable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, <hi>p.</hi> 24. of Dr. <hi>Walker, That in the written Copy of this Book (the Memorandum ſays,) there were ſome Corrections and Alterations written by K.</hi> Charles<hi>'s own hand; which the Author of the</hi> Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>preſſeth as an Argument, that the King was the Author, or otherwiſe there could be no reaſon given for his Majeſty's correcting the Manuſcript, and ſuffering it to paſs as a Book of his own Compoſure; for without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the King knew of the printing of it, having ſent to</hi> Royſton <hi>to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Preſs for ſomething that he would ſend him to be printed, four Months before.</hi> And the whole Book, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> owns, was in the Printer's hands in <hi>December,</hi> and the Copies publiſhed about the end of <hi>January;</hi> of which the King moſt probably was certified, it being his great Concern.</p>
               <p>Yet Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> anſwers, <hi>That what the Corrections by the King's own hand ſeemed to his Adverſary to be a Reaſon of, ſeems to Dr.</hi> Walker <hi>to be quite contrary; and ſays, That he aſſuredly believes this corrected Copy was that ſent by the Marqueſs of</hi> Hartford, <hi>from Dr.</hi> Gauden.</p>
               <p>To which it may be replied, That as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, it is not certain that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Book was ever delivered to the King; of which as hath been acknowledged by him, the Doctor had never any notice. Nor, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the King had leiſure at that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Seaſon, being worried by the Divines that were ſent to him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99534:19"/>in a tedious Diſpute concerning Church-Government, which he ſo well defended againſt them, as in the Account printed in his <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiae Carolina,</hi> which no Man did ever queſtion to be the King's own, but alſo by the Commiſſioners who were limited to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day, and by Delays and Unreaſonable Demands againſt both his Honour and Conſcience, ſo perplexed him, that he had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time or heart either to View or Correct another Man's Writings. But, <hi>thirdly,</hi> if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Copy ſent by the Marqueſs, was the Copy that was corrected by the King's own hand, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays he verily believes; then do I aſſuredly believe, that it was not that Copy by which the Book was printed, 1. Becauſe Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> having no return from the King concerning his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and Publiſhing of the Book, ſent the laſt parts of it to the Preſs by Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> ſee <hi>p.</hi> 33. whereas he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi> and Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> might ſee the corrected Copy at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> as Sir <hi>W. Dugdale</hi> affirms they did, and they attending his Majeſty till he was made a cloſe Priſoner, and by a Vote of the then Parliament for Non-addreſſes, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning his Sacred Perſon in <hi>Hurst-Caſtle,</hi> by order from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; which was, as <hi>Whitlock</hi> in his Memoirs notes, to be on the 4th of <hi>December:</hi> The King had no opportunity after that to ſend Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Book to the Preſs. And Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, That Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> would not write for a return of that Copy, but ſent another. So that the Premiſes conſidered, it is moſt probable that the whole Book was long before finiſhed by the King, with the Corrections viewed and brought into order, and fairly tranſcribed by Sir <hi>John Brattle</hi> and his Father, as Sir <hi>John</hi> hath atteſted; and then the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal returned to the King, who had it by him at the <hi>Iſle of Wight:</hi> But the Copy written by Sir <hi>J. Brattle</hi> and his Father, or which is more probable, by Mr. <hi>Odert,</hi> (for it was tranſcribed more than once, for fear of miſcarrying.) Was the Copy recommended to Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi> to fit it for the Preſs? who moſt probably did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the printing of it, becauſe the Proof-ſheets were ſent back to him as they were printed off, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> confeſſeth in a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Scory, <hi>p.</hi> 30. And this anſwers thoſe two Objections made by Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> p. 25. <hi>If the King himſelf had been the Author, why was not the Book in his own Hand-writing, as well as the Corrections and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations? And why any Corrections of a fair Copy, if he had finiſhed the Original himſelf before it was copied? Or why if he ſent it to be printed, did he not ſend the corrected Copy rather than an imperfect one which need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99534:20"/>his Correction and Alteration?</hi> All theſe Queſtions are briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered thus: The King's Book which was both written and correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his own hand, as Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> affirms, was tranſcribed fairly by another hand, and the Tranſcript ſent to the Preſs, the Original being returned to the King at the <hi>Iſle of Wight;</hi> and this is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the corrected Copy was not ſent to the Preſs. <hi>P.</hi> 20. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>That in more than forty Years there may be ſome Miſtake in Sir</hi> J. B. <hi>of other Papers for theſe, or ſome other lapſe of Memory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Reply,</hi> And why might not Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> in forty Years be guilty of a Miſtake or Lapſe of Memory about a Matter in which he was leſs concern'd than Sir <hi>John,</hi> for Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>He never read the Book in Manuſcript,</hi> which Sir <hi>John</hi> tranſcribed, and affirms it ſtill to have been the King's own hand. And why might he not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s declaring it to be his Book, when he declared only that he publiſhed the King's Book; though I ſee no ground to believe either. As for the corrected Copy, it will appear that the whole Book as well as the Corrections was the King's Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by this following Teſtimony under Mr. <hi>Richard Duke</hi>'s hand communicated to me: <hi>Sir, I confeſs that I heard Major</hi> Huntington <hi>to ſay more than once, That whilst he guarded</hi> Charles <hi>the First at</hi> Holmeby-houſe, <hi>(as I remember) he ſaw ſeveral Chapters or Leaves of that Great King's Meditations, lying on the Table, ſeveral Mornings, with a Pen and Ink, with which the King ſcratched out or blotted ſome Lines or Words of ſome of them. Upon which I must alſo confeſs, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded they were originally from the King: but others have drawn a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Argument from the King's correcting the Papers; yet I put this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my hand, that the Major told me, That he did ſuppoſe them original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from that Learned Prince. Which is the</hi> Totum <hi>that can be intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, Sir, your humble Servant,</hi> Richard Duke. This was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Dr. <hi>Charles Goodall, June</hi> 15, 1692, from whom I received it.</p>
               <p>This ſhews that the King was wont to correct his Meditations ſhortly after his penning of them; and the whole was his Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing, as well as the Corrections from the beginning.</p>
               <p>The Author of the <hi>Memorandum</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he inſerted it there (that is, in the void Leaf of a ſmall printed Copy,) for the Undeceiving others in this Point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I ſhould gueſs that the Earl was ſcarcely undeceived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Point, by the little heed and care which he took for the undeceiving of others: For firſt, <hi>It is likely,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Walker, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99534:20"/>no Eye had ſeen it from the time of the writing of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anne <hi>1675</hi>
                  </note> Nor did I ever hear that he declared to any other, though I preſumed to ask the Reverend Doctor <hi>Richard Anſley,</hi> the Earl's Son, and Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> concerning it: and I agree with Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> in this, <hi>That if Mr.</hi> Millington <hi>had not caſually opened it, it might have fallen into the hands of one that either had not regarded it, or would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it.</hi> p. 31. If the Earl had been fully convinced of the King's Relation, and intended to Undeceive others, as by the <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> it ſeems he intended to do, what ſhould hinder him to have made a more publick Declaration of a Truth, for which he had the Authority both of the King and Duke, not only to ſecure him, but to gratifie him for publiſhing what they were ſo willing ſhould be known: And if this thing was done in the Houſe of Lords, (as the <hi>Memorandum</hi> ſays) and where ſo great a Concourſe was, and a Matter fit to be known, was offered the King, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the ſight of his Father's Book wherein were the Corrections and Alterations written with the King's own hand, it's probable it was ſhown to ſome of the Nobles, who alſo might hear the Diſcourſe, and yet it was not ſpoken or dreamt of until this <hi>Memorandum</hi> was by chance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſome Years after.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall believe, unleſs the ſight of that Book convince me of the contrary, that it was wholly written with his Majeſty's own hand, as well as the Corrections, becauſe I have the Teſtimonies of many competent Witneſſes to induce me ſo to believe, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Levet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Herbert,</hi> Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> and that Captain who was converted by it, when the King was even ready to die on his Croſs. Nor can I believe that the Noble Earl did write that <hi>Memorandum,</hi> as we have it; there are many in <hi>London</hi> can counterfeit any Man's Writing: We know how his Majeſty was abuſed by counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Broad-Seal; but neither doth the <hi>Memorandum</hi> ſay, That the Book was not of the King's Writing, only that the Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, which excludes not the other; and though that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Book were not, yet one there was written wholly by the King, as is irrefragably proved. I deſire the Reader therefore to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that I reflect not on the Earl's hand, for which we have no Proof, and becauſe we hear not of any thing ſpoken or done by the Earl to Undeceive the People in that Point, which if he had been willing to do, he could never have a better opportunity than then when the King, the Duke, and as we may believe, a great number of the Lords, the higheſt Judicature of the Nation were in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99534:21"/>Houſe; then, I ſay, was the fitteſt time (if the Earl had been as willing to Undeceive the Nation, as the King and Duke were,) and the faireſt opportunity to do it, by ſhewing them the Book, many of the Lords then preſent knowing the King's Hand, and not to leave it in a void Leaf of a Twelve-peny Book, left undiſcovered to the day of his death: I may alſo preſume that that Learned Earl (who was as great a Lover of Truth as of Books,) having ſuch a Book ſometime (how long I know not,) in his hands, would either before or after it had been ſhewn to the King and Duke, have compared the Print with the Copy; and then if he had found any conſiderable Alterations, he would have mentioned them in his <hi>Memorandum,</hi> as the Ground of being undeceived himſelf, and a farther Means to Undeceive the Nation. And thus much for the <hi>Memorandum,</hi> which I think never did Undeceive any except Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 6 and 7. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> affirms, <hi>That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>had taken the Covenant;</hi> If this be true, I ſee no cauſe why he ſhould have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the beſt Biſhoprick in <hi>England,</hi> though he might be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that of <hi>Exeter</hi> for other good Services which he did after he became a Convert, and wrote againſt the Covenant; for when Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> that had taken the Covenant, and as ſome ſay the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, was preferred to <hi>Norwich,</hi> which is much better than <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and other Biſhopricks were offered to others that were leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving. And, <hi>p.</hi> 129. of his <hi>Anti-Baal Berith,</hi> he calls God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that <hi>Exeter</hi> was granted him by the King's Favour, and the general Deſire of the City and Dioceſs of <hi>Exeter,</hi> without any his own or others ambitious procuring or ſolliciting in his behalf, I cannot perſwade myſelf, that if Bp. <hi>Duppa</hi> and thoſe other great Men to whom the diſpoſe of the Biſhopricks was committed, had known that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> bad written the King's Book, would have ſet him below Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and divers others that had done leſs Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if there had been no other reaſon for it but to engage him to Silence in ſo important a Secret.</p>
               <p>But what if Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> do ſlander his Patron Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> and it ſhould appear that he never did take the Covenant, no not in any ſence? I have ſo much Deference to the Worth of that Biſhop, as well as Gratitude, as he was my Patron, that I ſhall propoſe the Reaſons why I think Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> hath injured him in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; and if it appear to the Reader that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> is injurious in this, he will be induced to believe, that he is not to be credited in his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99534:21"/>other Relation, <hi>viz. That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>told him, that he wrote the King's Book. P.</hi> 275. of the <hi>Anti-Baal,</hi> The ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was made and anſwered as followeth:<note place="margin">That Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had taken the Covenant.</note> 
                  <hi>For Dr.</hi> Gauden<hi>'s making one of the Number of his Covenanters, as Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>reckoneth without his Host. To ſatisfie Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>and the Libeller's Curioſity, who go by Hearſay, Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>aſſures the World, That he never took any Oaths but thoſe appointed by the Law, no Proteſtation nor Engagement, no League, Vow, or Negative Oath; and for this Covenant he offered freely to ſome principle Authors of it, his many just Scruples and Objections against it, both as to its Matter and Authority: He had ſome of their Anſwers under their Hands, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Sence his Charity was, and is willing to interpret the meaning of the Covenant, to reform, not ruine Epiſcopacy; then he declared publickly his Judgment for Biſhops and Epiſcopacy, to be ſuch as now it is, That he neither could, nor ever would aſſent to the Covenant in any Sence, but ſuch as was in his Freedom to refuſe, and conſiſtent with his former Oaths, the Laws of the Land, and the Preſervation of Epiſcopal Government in its just Rights and Enjoyments, in Piety, Loyalty, and in thoſe Duties of Equity and Charity, which he owed to God and Man. Further than this, Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>never approved nor owned the Covenant, nor ever ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it: How good ſoever it ſhall ſeem in ſome things and Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet an evil Sence must not be covered under good Words, nor any Godly Expreſſions be afterwards wreſted to abet Ungodly Actions; the whole Maſs of the Covenant ſeemed to be ſweetned by thoſe general Salvo's and Reſtrictions put into it,</hi> Of having Regard in all things to the Word of GOD, to the Duties of Mens Places and Callings, and to the Power of Godlineſs. <hi>Let Mr.</hi> Crofton <hi>keep to theſe, and ſo keep his Covenant, for ſurely theſe can bind no Man to any thing injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any honeſt Man, or honeſt Office in Church or State. Of Dr.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<hi>'s free and publick Declaration of his Judgment as to the Covenant in general and particular, Hundreds beſides God and his own Conſcience, are Witneſſes; and if ſuch a Declaration of his Sence, what ought to be the meaning of it in Conſcience and Honeſty, will add any ſtrength to Mr.</hi> Crof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton<hi>'s Sence of it, or the Deſign of making it Sacred not Sacrilegious, much good do them: I believe they will ſooner be drawn to Dr.</hi> Gauden<hi>'s ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Epiſcopacy, than to their Presbyterian Exorbitancy, which he ever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly abhorred, and never ſecretly complied with; if he had, it had been as much againſt his Conſcience as againſt Reaſon, Law, Juſtice, Charity, and Religion; and he muſt have had no Peace till he had publickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and recanted ſuch Diſſimulation, which he abhors as Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:99534:22"/>Now though ſome Men might expect that the Doctor ſhould have poſitively declared, that he never took the Covenant, and think theſe large Circumlocutions to be but an Evaſion, and raiſing of Duſt to blind Mens eyes, let the Reader reflect, That in the firſt place he writes this to <hi>aſſure the World</hi> that he never took any Oaths but thoſe appointed by Law, which he expreſly denyeth the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to have been: And the Doctor knew that Oaths are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be taken in the uſual ſence of the words in which it is penned, and according to the meaning of thoſe who impoſe it. <hi>2ly,</hi> That he expreſly mentioneth any Engagement, League, or Vow, under which Terms the Covenant muſt be comprehended. <hi>3ly,</hi> That he declared publickly his Judgment for Biſhops and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, as by Law was eſtabliſhed in <hi>England, p.</hi> 277. which the Covenant diametrically oppoſed. <hi>4ly,</hi> That he never would nor could aſſent to the Covenant in any Sence, but ſuch as was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with his former Oaths, the Laws of the Land, and Preſervation of Epiſcopal Government in its juſt Rights and Enjoyments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which the taking of the Covenant directly oppoſed. <hi>5ly,</hi> That his Compliance with the Presbyterian Exorbitance would have been ſuch a Diſſimulation as he abhorred as Hell. And after all this publiſhed to aſſure the World againſt that Objection, <hi>viz. That he was one of the Number of Covenanters;</hi> which he ſays Mr. <hi>Crof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> reckoned him without his Hoſt. I ſhould think it a very ſtrong Argument (that though he ſhould have told Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> that he wrote the King's Book,) he were not to be believed being <hi>Teſtis ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi inconſiſtens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any Faith or Honeſty in Men, theſe Reaſons which Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> gives may ſatisfie the Reader that he never took the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for Page 178, he declares, <hi>That if the Parliament had been full, they had not any power to make, take, or impoſe any Oath contrary to the Laws of</hi> England, <hi>which they were entruſted to obſerve, not to break, abrogate, or change without the K.'s Conſent.</hi> And in the ſame Page he ſaith, <hi>He is confident he doth thoſe Men no Injury, who were the chief Engines and Charioteers, to ſay, they did all things more out of Polity than Piety; and by this Covenant they intended the advance of a Party, not of the Publick Intereſt, and our Laws,</hi> Ad quas evertendas nemo ſobrius acceſſit: Which he thus <hi>Engliſheth, To the Subverſion of which by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Combinations and Covenantings without the Prince's or Supream Power's Conſent, no Man comes but drunk with Pride, or Paſſion, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Covetouſneſs, or Superſtition.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 279. he ſays, <hi>It is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99534:22"/>to take a falſe and unjust Oath, as well as to break a true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Oath.</hi> Now who will believe Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> ſo as to think Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to be guilty of all theſe horrid Crimes, which he condemns in others. In Page the 69th, he ſays, <hi>That in the intended Sence it was execrable, and that every ſuch Covenanter must be ſo to GOD and Man— nothwithſtanding the remaining Lords and Commons in the two Houſes, and the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Commiſſioners, and the Aſſembly</hi> (all Sacred no doubt,) <hi>did take the Covenant,</hi> Sept. 11th, 1643: Which he ſcoffs at in <hi>p.</hi> 70, and in <hi>p.</hi> 71. he declares what he means by the words Oath, Vow, and League, ſaying, That <hi>no Vow, Oath, League, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Covenant can bind contrary to our Duty to God, the King, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the Church and Laws under which we live.</hi> In <hi>p.</hi> 80. That <hi>the Authority impoſing it was not Legal.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 81. <hi>That ſuch Vows bind to nothing but the breaking of them.</hi> And in <hi>p.</hi> 111. <hi>That we read not of any Covenant ever ſo impoſed, or taken by any Subjects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or against the Conſent of their Soveraign's Power; but it proved a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Iſſue, hardly cured with a Miracle, and that after the Effuſion of much Civil Blood. P.</hi> 184 He tells his Reader how the Covenant was blaſted by the <hi>Oxford</hi> Reaſons. And <hi>p.</hi> 185. <hi>That this Combination against Epiſcopacy without doubt first damnified and deſtroyed the former King: Of which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have greater grounds than it is fit to tell all the World.</hi> That it was contrary to the Oaths of Allegiance, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, and Canonical Obedience, he proves at large, <hi>p.</hi> 189, 195, 197.</p>
               <p>Now what a Monſter of Men muſt he be, that knowing all theſe things before, ſhould take ſuch a Covenant in any ſence whatſoever, or having taken it, ſhould expect ſo great a Preferment as the Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter?</hi> Here then we have Dr. <hi>W.</hi> brought to this Dilemma, If Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> did take the Covenant, he was guilty of all that he condemned in others, <hi>(ut ſupra;)</hi> and then that Argument which Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> urged to his Tutor, whereby he ſays he could have ſilenced him, <hi>viz. That Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>wrote the Chapter against the Covenant, becauſe he ſpake ſo much in favour of it;</hi> is very weak: And if he wrote not that, then probably no other of that Book. And if he did not take it, (as I am in Charity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd he did not,) how Criminal was Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to publiſh to the World, to the Defamation of his good Patron, that communicated his Secrets to him, that he was ſo vile a Man as to make himſelf guilty of all thoſe horrid Crimes abovementioned: and then alſo it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, that he that durſt raiſe ſo evil a Report of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99534:23"/>to the Covenant, might preſume to ſix this Phantome of his own on the Doctor, <hi>That the Doctor told him, that he made the K.'s Book.</hi> And whether Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> did affirm it to Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> miſreported Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> both, theſe Teſtimonies are very infirm, and cannot ſtand againſt the oppoſite Reaſons and Authorities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 32. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> anſwers to four things objected by Sir <hi>W. Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, The moſt material,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>is concerning Major</hi> Huntington, <hi>from whoſe mouth, he ſays he will in the Faith of a Chriſtian declare, without diminution or wreſting of it,</hi> (which he ſays was this,) <hi>p.</hi> 33. <hi>When that Book was publiſhed, and ſo confidently reported to be the King's, then ſurely, or I believe</hi> (here ſomething is wanting, or his hand trembled,) <hi>theſe are the Papers I ſee him ſo uſually take out of his Cabinet; but this was but my Conjecture, and I never declared it to be otherwiſe, for I aſſure you, I never read one Line or Word of the Papers in the King's hand; and I cannot ſay there was one Paſſage in theſe Papers which is this printed Book, for how ſhould I never having look'd into them.</hi> This Account of Major <hi>Huntington</hi> he ſays he faithfully relates as in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>Now if Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> be proved by ſeveral Witneſſes of good Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, to have reported a Relation greatly different from that which the Major gave to ſeveral Friends and Relations at ſeveral times, concerning the Matter in queſtion: I ſuppoſe the agreeing Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of ſeveral ſuch competent Witneſſes, will greatly invalidate Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Relation; and if the Reader ſhall be convinced that Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> hath miſreported Major <hi>Huntington</hi>'s Teſtimony, it may be a Prejudice to his Report of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s: Now firſt Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>p.</hi> 32. <q>That he often heard Major <hi>Huntington</hi>'s Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be this,</q> 
                  <hi>That whilst he attended his Majeſty, or had the guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, he ſaw the King frequently take theſe Papers out of his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and ſometimes read them, ſometimes wrote more; and that when he ſaw the Book, he declared, Thoſe Chapters in it were thoſe very Papers he had ſo ſeen.</hi> Which two Relations are contradictory. Now it is very probable, that what Dr <hi>Walker</hi> affirms he ſo often heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as Major <hi>Huntington</hi>'s Teſtimony, might come to the Major's ears in his Life-time, and had he diſliked it, would have contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it to ſuch Friends as inquired the Truth of that Buſineſs, whoſe Teſtimonies I ſhall now ſet down; And firſt, the Teſtimony of the Learned Dr. <hi>Robert Hall,</hi> Son of the Famous <hi>Joſeph Hall,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who was Treaſurer of the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Exon,</hi> to whom the Major was near related by his Marriage, and with whom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99534:23"/>he ſojourn'd ſometime at <hi>Clist-hidon,</hi> the Doctor's Benefice: this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Dr. <hi>Hall</hi> hath told me and others, <q>That Major <hi>Huntington</hi> waiting on his Majeſty at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> aſſured him, that he had ſeen the King writing ſome of thoſe Papers, which the Major had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to read, and knew that ſuch as he did then read, were the ſame as are now printed.</q> To this of Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> I add that of <hi>Richard Duke,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and Juſtice of the Peace in <hi>Devon,</hi> who lately declared to me and another Judicious Divine, <q>That he heard the Major affirm the ſame, almoſt in the ſame words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And Sir <hi>Will. Courtney,</hi> a Perſon of great Honour, (as I am cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed) when this Relation was read or told to him, as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> reported it, was pleaſed immediately to ſay, <q>That he well knew the Major, and had heard him aver the like Report as Mr. <hi>Duke</hi> and others have declared.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Evidences confirm what Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> relates, <hi>p.</hi> 21. of his Defence, <hi>That a Non-conforming Miniſter told him,</hi> (viz.) <hi>That Major</hi> Huntington <hi>told him with his own mouth, That he procured ſome Papers that made up part of this Royal Book from the hands of</hi> Fairfax <hi>the Parliament General, which were taken after</hi> Nazby <hi>Fight, and kept by the Lord</hi> Fairfax; <hi>and that afterward the ſaid Major preſented them to the King with his own hand.</hi> Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> adds, <hi>I ſpare the Man's Name for particular Reaſons; but if I am called to do it, I will depoſe the Truth of his Saying ſo upon Oath.</hi> But I hope the Teſtimonies now following will prevent that labour; the firſt is that of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Will.

And I do farther Certifie, That one <hi>Rich. Duke,</hi> of <hi>Otterton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Devon,</hi> Eſquire, being then at the Biſhop's Table, did poſitively affirm, That what I had repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted concerning Major <hi>Huntington</hi> was true, he knowing well the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99534:24"/>ſaid Major, and having heard him with his own mouth affirming to him, that what I have above ſet down was true: In witneſs whereof I have hereunto ſet my Hand this 18th day of <hi>July, A. D.</hi> 1692.</q>

Pilkington,</hi> the late Lord-Mayor, he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to meet with Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> at that Table, where Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> with his uſual Confidence aſſerted Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> to be the Author of the King's Book: On which Dr. <hi>Meriton</hi> turned upon him with the Story of Mr. <hi>Simmonds</hi>'s communicating the whole buſineſs to Dr. <hi>Gauden.</hi>
                  </q> Upon which he was ſo confounded that he had nothing to ſay for himſelf; which being ſeconded by Mr. <hi>Marriot,</hi> then Chaplain to the Lord-Mayor, who heard the whole Diſcourſe, and withal the Silence that he put Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> to; Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to give the World an account of it in Print, <q>This, ſaith Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> p. 5. of the Character of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, is ſo true, and will upon juſt occaſion be atteſted by others as well as myſelf, that I do here in the face of the World, challenge Dr. <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riton</hi> or Mr. <hi>Marriot</hi> to deny one Syllable of the Subſtance of it, either as to the one in telling his Succeſs in the Diſpute, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtifying it as really true.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>p.</hi> 11 of Dr. <hi>H.</hi>'s <hi>Defence,</hi> he ſays, <q>That Mrs. <hi>Simmonds</hi> being askt by him, How far her Husband was concerned in the King's Book? And what ſhe knew of it? She anſwered, That going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Husband's Study, ſhe ſaw on the Table a Book in Writing, which ſhe knew not to be her Husband's Writing, ſhe asked him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99534:24"/>whoſe it was; which he turning her off with bidding her mind her own buſineſs, ſhe deſiſted from further Enquiry. The King's Murder following quickly after, ſhe told me her Husband never joyed himſelf, but fell ſick, and died the 29th of <hi>March</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and throughout his whole Sickneſs he declared the Book was the King's Book.</q> And <hi>p.</hi> 26. Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> ſays, <q>That Mrs. <hi>Simmonds</hi> dining ſome Years ſince at a Citizen's Houſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, he told her, If ſhe would confeſs the Truth, that her Husband made the Book, there were ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Pounds at her Service. She knowing her Husband's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in his Death-bed Aſſertions, ſcorned, and told him, She was not to be bribed by never ſo much to ſo great a Lie.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have alſo an Authentick Teſtimony communicated to me by Dr. <hi>Charles Goodall,</hi> 
                  <q>That Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> had often waited on his Grace the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was wont to ask his Grace, Whether he deſired to be informed concerning the true Author of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>? affirming, that not the King but Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> was the Author of it: adding this as a Reaſon, That Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had a Copy before it was publiſhed. This only Argument he alledged to his Grace; but as for all thoſe other Aſſertions which are ſince vented in his Book, Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> at no time made uſe of them to confirm what he had delivered. Further, my Lord told me, That Mr. <hi>Levet,</hi> the Author of the Letter printed in <hi>Reſtittuion to the Royal Author,</hi> had often, and many Years ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively waited on him, and entring into diſcourſe on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did as often conſtantly aver, (as related in the printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) That he waiting on his Majeſty in Priſon, had ſeen the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sheets of the Book written with the King's own hand, and interlined by him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I ſhall joyn the Teſtimony of another Archbiſhop, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent in a Sermon preached in <hi>Dublin</hi> by the R. R. <hi>Henry</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi> at the Funeral of <hi>James Margetſon,</hi> D. D. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> which was printed at <hi>London</hi> for <hi>Nath. Ranew,</hi> at the King's Arms in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-yard, 1679. in the 28th Page of that Book, the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> tells us the following Paſſage was atteſted by the Archbiſhop, whoſe Words by all that knew him, paſt as unqueſtionable, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 
                  <q>That the Archbiſh. being in <hi>London</hi> after the Death of the Royal Martyr, did adminiſter the laſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church to a Gentleman on his Death-bed, (whoſe Name he mentions not) but ſays,</q> 
                  <hi>That a dying Perſon told him, that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99534:25"/>he had been one ſometimes near in Attendance on that Sacred Martyr in his Solitude, and that to him were committed by the King thoſe Papers, which he ſaid he knew to have been written by the King's own hand, and which were after publiſhed with the Title of</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which the Biſhop of <hi>Meath</hi> obſerved for obviating malicious Speeches detract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from that excellent Work breathing Piety and Devotion, and vindicating the Sincerity of that Great Soul in all his Actings and Occurrencies therein mentioned; Malice ſuggeſting to the World that although that Work carried the King's Name, yet it was not his own, but compoſed by ſome of his Chaplains; intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to leſſen his Majeſty's great and excellent Parts, and to render that moſt excellent Piece leſs regarded, and their own Wickedneſs leſs obſerved. <hi>By this Teſtimony</hi> (ſaith the Biſhop of <hi>Meath,</hi>) <hi>that falſe Aſſertion appears, and the Royal Author of that precious Work found to be the King himſelf, it being declared by ſuch a Perſon dying, and ſo could hope for no Advantage by it.</hi> This Sermon was printed about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years ſince.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added the Teſtimony of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi> who was often heard to affirm, <hi>That after the Fight at</hi> Naz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>the King being much troubled for the loſs of his Papers taken in his Cabinet, commanded him to endeavour the Recovery of them, which he did to the King's great Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that of Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> who was the King's Keeper in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> who atteſted, <hi>That he ſaw thoſe Papers in the King's hand, heard him reading them, and ſaw him correcting them.</hi> As Dr. <hi>Perin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheiff</hi> in the Life of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, <hi>p.</hi> 95.</p>
               <p>To theſe may be added that of Dr. <hi>Dillingham,</hi> p. 22. of Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi>'s <hi>Defence,</hi> 
                  <q>That he waiting on the King after that he was ſeized by the Army, ſaw and read in the King's Bed-Chamber a whole Chapter of the King's Book freſh written with his own hand, in the Year 1647.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Fowler</hi>'s Teſtimony, the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confirmation, <hi>p.</hi> 23. of Dr. <hi>H.</hi>'s <hi>Defence, (viz.)</hi> 
                  <q>That Mrs. <hi>Keightly</hi> of <hi>Albrohatch,</hi> in <hi>Barking</hi> Pariſh, in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> gave him this Account about twenty eight Years ſince,</q> 
                  <hi>That ſhe had a Servant who was made a Parliament Captain, and a little before the King's death, told her he had laid down his Commiſſion; and ſhe asking him the reaſon, he replyed, That whereas he had been told, that the King was a very bad Man, he was now abundantly aſſured that he is an excellent good Man. And being askt what induced him to judge ſo; told her, That he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99534:25"/>was appointed to ſtand every Morning at his Majeſty's Bed-Chamber-door, when he was a Priſoner in the</hi> Iſle of Wight, <hi>obſerving for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, that the King went into his Cloſet quickly after he was dreſſed, and there ſtayed a conſiderable time, and then went down into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and perceiving that he left the Key in the Cloſet-door, he adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go in, and found that he had been penning moſt devout and pious Meditations and Prayers, which he fell to reading, till he ſaw the King return to the Walk that lead to his Chamber: And thus the Captain did for ſeveral Mornings, and read the King's Morning-works, till he came to a Reſolution no longer to be ſuch a Prince's Jaybor.</hi> 
                  <q>Mrs. <hi>Keighley</hi> told me further,</q> 
                  <hi>That he gave ſuch an account of thoſe Meditations and Prayers, that ſhe was confident they were printed in</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>after ſhe came to read that Book.</hi> 
                  <q>This Mrs. <hi>Keighly</hi> was a very Religious and Pious Gentlewoman, and as Diſcreet and Prudent. This I atteſt, <hi>Edward Fowler,</hi> D. D. <hi>June</hi> 25th, 1691.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now let the Reader judge, who are likely to declare <hi>in the Faith of a Chriſtian,</hi> what they had from the mouth of Major <hi>Huntington,</hi> whether the talkative Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> who is <hi>Singularis Teſtis,</hi> or thoſe many Perſons of great Note whoſe agreeing Teſtimonies I have produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 34. he anſwers Mr. <hi>William Levet</hi>'s Teſtimony, which ſays, <q>That he could depoſe, that the Book was his, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the King's own, having oftentimes obſerved his Majeſty writing his Royal Reſentments of the Bold and Inſolent Behaviour of the Souldiers that had him in their Cuſtody; and that he had the Happineſs oftentimes to read the ſame in Manuſcript, under his Majeſty's own hand, he being pleaſed to leave the ſame in the Window of his Bed-chamber.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Anſwer is, <hi>That there is no ſuch Chapter in all that Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reply.</hi> Neither did Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> affirm there was; but he that ſhall read the 23d Chapter of the <hi>Scots</hi> delivering him up to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and his Captivity at <hi>Holmeby;</hi> and Chap. 26. of the Army's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing him at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and in the following Chapters, he may find too much both of the Inſolency of his Rebellious Subjects, and the Barbarous Demeanor of the Souldiers, from whom he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſaſſination. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> grants that Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> might read it in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> but will not believe it was the King's writing, unleſs it be underſtood of the Corrections only, which he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the King made in the Book ſent by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> or elſe that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99534:26"/>his Majeſty had tranſcribed it. But Mr. <hi>Levet</hi> ſaith he often read it in Manuſcript, under the King's own hand; and what a ſtrange Fancy is it of Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that the King in that Hurry of Buſineſs ſhould tranſcribe ſo large a Book with his hand, when he had ſo little time to diſpatch more urgent Affairs.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Levet</hi>'s Teſtimony is as follows, <hi>p.</hi> 8 and 9. of Dr. <hi>Holling.</hi>'s Character of K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, <hi>If any one deſire to know the true Author of a Book intituled,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>I, one of the Servants of K.</hi> Charles <hi>the First's, in his Bed-Chamber, do declare, That when his Majeſty was a Priſoner in the</hi> Iſle of Wight, <hi>that I read over the ſaid Book, which was long before the Book was printed, in his Bed-Chamber, writ with his Majeſty's own hand, with ſeveral Interlinings. Moreover, his Majeſty,</hi> Charles <hi>the First, told me,</hi> Sure <hi>Levet,</hi> you do deſign to get this Book by heart; <hi>(having often ſeen me reading of it.) I can teſtifie alſo, That</hi> Royſton <hi>the Printer, told me, that he was impriſoned by</hi> O. Cromwell, <hi>becauſe he would not declare, that King</hi> Charles <hi>the First was not the Author of the ſaid Book.</hi> Sign'd and Seal'd <hi>Octob.</hi> 16th, 1690.</p>
               <p>To which add this Teſtimony, <hi>I</hi> Robert Herne, <hi>formerly Servant to Sir</hi> Philip Warwick, <hi>do attest, That I have often heard Sir</hi> Philip Warwick, <hi>as alſo Mr.</hi> Odert, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Whitaker, <hi>declare, That they had tranſcribed Copies of the King's Book written with his own hand. Witneſs my hand,</hi> Robert Herne.</p>

                  <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 34. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> gives the Reaſons for publiſhing his Book, <hi>p.</hi> 34 and 35. 1ſt, <hi>It was impoſed on him by Dr.</hi> H. <hi>for his own Vindication, and to wipe off a falſe Accuſation, That he was guilty of a falſe Story by a free owning of what he forced me to write.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 35. ſays, <hi>It was wrung and wreſted from him by ſome Body's impertinent Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation to meddle with what he underſtands not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It was was no impertinent Employment for any Member of that Church which honoureth that King as their Royal Martyr, to undertake the neceſſary Vindication of his being Author of that Book, which as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> obſerves, did render the Murther of ſo good a King to be more abhorred. 2. Did awaken many to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who had contributed to it. 3. Did diſpoſe the Nation to recal the Royal Family, and many more good Effects; which if the Nation were impoſed on, and it ſhould paſs as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> would have it, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was the Author of it, would be accounted as a Sham, not only to the Infamy of Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> the Contriver, and Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> the Concealer, but to the Diminution of the King's
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99534:26"/>deſerved Honour, and revive their old Calumnies of covering foul Deeds with fair Pretences.</p>
               <p>And as for Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Negative Reaſons in <hi>p.</hi> 35. <q>That he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not by this Diſcovery to rob that excellent King of any Honour properly due to him,</q> will appear to be no Reaſons, nor will the Station in which he then was, <hi>(viz.)</hi> A Chaplain at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>-Houſe, perſwade the Reader to believe, that no Man of his Rank loved the King better, honoured him more while he lived, or more abhorred his Murder, bewayled his Death, giving more open Teſtimony againſt it, or ſuſtaining greater Loſs for ſo doing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> gives us his Poſitive Reaſons drawn from two ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Providences, the one ſerving as an Apology why he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal this Secret ſooner, and the other why he did it now: It much amuſeth me, that a Doctor of Divinity ſhould make Providence a Party with himſelf, to croſs itſelf, and juſtifie two ſuch contrary Ends, and declare, <hi>That whatever others may think, he judgeth it a ſign that God would have that which he calls a pious Fraud, an officious Lie, a talking deceitfully for Man, to the maintaing of which he thinks he contributed by his Silence, and for which he was perſwaded by many co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Reaſons, that God was not well pleaſed with Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>himſelf, and others.</hi> And then for <hi>what Reaſon he knows not,</hi> p. 35. as he confeſſeth, but only thinks that Providence may have other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now to ſerve, by ſuffering this Diſcovery to be wreſted and wrung from him by ſome Body's impertinent Affectation to meddle in what they underſtood not.</p>
               <p>The ſence of which is this: God's Providence in recovering the King's Paper's, (which <hi>Arwaker</hi> had ſeized (as in <hi>p.</hi> 30, 31. he ſhews in a large Harangue,) and ſuffering them to be printed, was Dr. <hi>W.</hi>'s Reaſon why he did for about forty three Years conceal an Impoſture put on the whole Nation, ſuch as was a Trouble to his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and diſpleaſing to God: And the ſame Providence by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> to wring and wreſt from him this Diſcovery, (which if his Conſcience had been really grieved for concealing it, he ſhould have revealed freely and meekly as a Penitent,) ſhould force him afterward to publiſh to ſalve his own Reputation.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> p. 31. mentions another ſignal Providence for his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, <hi>viz.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s <hi>Memorandum,</hi> found in a void Leaf of the King's Book, which if it had not been caſually opened by Mr. <hi>Millington,</hi> but fallen into ſome hand that either might not regard it, or would have concealed it, then Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi> would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99534:27"/>not ſo unſeaſonably have provoked Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> would have been as ſilent as Providence in this matter.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Part, If all thoſe Imperfections which may Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate an Evidence, do meet in this of Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s, and there are the joynt Teſtimonies of ſeveral Unexceptionable Perſons againſt his Evidence, the Caſe may eaſily be determin'd: Firſt then, Dr. <hi>Walk.</hi>'s Evidence is but the ſingle Teſtimony of what he heard from Dr. <hi>Gauden;</hi> and <hi>Maſcard</hi> in his 1361 Concluſion <hi>de Probationibus</hi> ſays, <hi>Teſtis unicus de Auditis nil probat;</hi> and in his 1360 Concluſion, N. 5. <hi>Teſtis unicus ut faciat ſemiplenum probationem debet eſſe omni ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptione major.</hi> Which they that conſider the Premiſes will hardly believe of Dr. <hi>Walker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A Witneſs that depoſeth things very unlikely, doth not prove them becauſe <hi>veri ſimilitudine</hi> is the ground of Truth; ſo Concluſ. 1364. <hi>Teſtis non veri ſimilia deponens non probat;</hi> and, <hi>Teſtimonii fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum est fides.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the King's Book had paſt for his own above forty Years, and <hi>ad reprobandum inſtrumentum Teſtes omni exceptione majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res requiruntur.</hi> Concluſ. 1360. N. 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that producing another to confirm what he had witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and finds his Fellow-witneſs to affirm what he denied, or deny what he affirmed, rendreth his Evidence ſuſpected; this the Doctor hath often done, particularly in Major <hi>Hnntington</hi>'s Evidence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced for him. <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1368.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Witneſs that without a Call offers himſelf to give Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> did to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Companies, is not approved by <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1358. Nor he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes his Teſtimony with Eagerneſs and Animoſity, for, <hi>Animoſe deponens ſuſpectus redditur.</hi> Concluſ. 1368.</p>

               <p>So that we may conclude with that Great Civilian, That Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Teſtimony ought not to prevail againſt the Teſtimony of ſo many competent Witneſſes, becauſe he labours under ſo many Defects.</p>
               <p>The Reſult of what I have written will be this: That Dr. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>'s ſingle and incoherent Evidence of what he pretends to have heard from Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> cannot deſerve any Credit againſt the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of ſo many Authentick Witneſſes of the Matter of Fact, as have given their Evidence for the King's being Author of the

               <p>If Dr <hi>Walker</hi> who profeſt ſo much Love to the Royal Martyr for his Wiſdom and Piety, a Member of that Church for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of which in purſuance of his pious Reſolution to defend it or make it his Tomb-ſtone, the King ſacrificed his Life, hath ſo ſhameleſly martyr'd him a ſecond time in his Eſſigies or Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, what wonder is it if his profeſſed Enemies that hated him as a King, to divide his Inheritance among them, ſhould perpetuate their immortal Hatred againſt him, in hope to regain that part of his and the Church's Inheritance which by the Hire of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, they had ſacrilegiouſly purchaſed. And if the conſident Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> be found ſo faulty, how incredible is it that the late Libels written under the Name of <hi>Ludlow,</hi> a Regicide, ſhould have ſo much appearance of Truth or ſhadow of Honeſty as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any other Confutation, than what was long ſince due to their Authors: Sure I am a few ſuch Accountants as the Doctor and <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> would ſoon make the Kingdom become Bankrupt.</p>

               <p>NOW ſuppoſe all that hath hitherto been ſpoken to prove that the King, and not Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was the Author of the Book, be laid aſide, and taken as <hi>non dictum,</hi> yet I ſuppoſe what may be produced, <hi>1st,</hi> From conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the K.'s Abilities to write ſuch a Book. <hi>2ly,</hi> From his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he deſign'd to write it. <hi>3ly,</hi> From his Teſtimony that he had done it. <hi>4ly,</hi> From the Characters which may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that Book of the Royal Author, which appear as plain as his Image and Superſcription on his Coin, and do as naturally own each other, as the Ewe doth the Lamb, will abundantly convince
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99534:28"/>the Reader that it was the King's, and not Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Work, for though he be dead, yet he ſpeaks very intelligibly to any that have had any knowledge of his Royal Eloquence: And this I ſhall prove, Firſt from his known Abilities to write ſuch a Book; that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was from his Childhood devoted to his Studies, and being of a quick Apprehenſion, did lay up a great Stock of Humane and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Knowledge.</p>
               <p>That you may not read the Teſtimonies of his Friends with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, I ſhall firſt ſhew you what Opinion his Adverſaries had of him, one of the moſt bitter I account <hi>Cooke,</hi> who ſolicited againſt him at his Tryal, who in his Apology for their Proceeding againſt him, <hi>p.</hi> 35. ſays, <hi>He was well known to be a hard Student in his young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er days: He had more Learning and dexterity in State-affairs undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than all the Kings in</hi> Chriſtendom; <hi>and for his Parts, if they had been ſanctified, he was another</hi> Soloman.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Teſtimony is that of <hi>Lilly,</hi> who in his Diſcourſe of Monarchy, or no Monarchy, (whom I mention not as an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger, but as a Man of Sence, that was an Obſerver of the Perſons and Actions of the Times,) he ſays, <hi>That he had ſingular Skill in Limning and Pictures, a good Mathematician, not unskilful in Muſick, well read in Divinity, excellently in Hiſtory, and no leſs in the Laws and Statutes of the Nation, of a quick and ſharp Conception, would write his Mind ſingularly well, in good Language and Stile; he would apprehend a Difference between Parties with great Readineſs, and Methodize a long Matter in few Lines; inſomuch that I have heard Sir</hi> Robert Holborn <hi>oft ſay, He had a quicker Conception, and eaſier underſtood a Cauſe in Law, and with more Sharpneſs drove the Matter to a Head, than any of the Privy-Council; and when the King was not there, Sir</hi> Robert <hi>cared not to be there. He had alſo among other ſpecial Gifts, the Gift of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo that he would hear out a long Diſcourſe without Interruption or Diſtaſte; he had a diſcerning Eye to judge of Men, and honoured the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; he was not at all given to Luxury, but extream temperate in his Food and Apparel; he would Argue Logically, and frame his Arguments Artificially,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For which I may give an Inſtance in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Hender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who hath at large declared his Judgment of the King, after his Diſputation with him, it is at large in the Character of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> to this effect: <hi>I do declare to God and the World, That ſince I had the Honour and Happineſs to Converſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with his Majeſty, eſpecially in Matters of Religion, that I found him
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99534:29"/>the most Intelligent Man that ever I ſpoke with, as far beyond my Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as Expectation: I profeſs that I was oft-times aſtoniſhed with the Quickneſs and Solidity of his Reaſons and Replys, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndring how among his Sports and Recreations he attained ſo great Knowledge. I confeſs ingeniouſly, that I was convinc'd in Conſcience, and know not how to give him any reaſonable Satisfaction; yet the Sweetneſs of his Diſpoſition is ſuch, that whatever I ſaid was well taken: I must ſay that I never met with any Diſputant let be a King, and in Matters of ſo high Concernment, of that mild and calm Temper, which convinced me more to think that ſuch Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Moderation could not be without extraordinary meaſure of Divine Grace. I had heard much of his Carriage toward the Prieſts in</hi> Spain, <hi>and that K.</hi> James <hi>told the D. of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>That he durst venture his Son</hi> Charles <hi>against all the Jeſuits, he knowing him to be ſo well grounded in the Proteſtant Religion; but could never believe it before I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved particularly his Devotion, which I must truly ſay was more than ordinary, and was obſerved by him before his Troubles; twice a Day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Morning and Evening for an Hour's ſpace in private, twice a Day before Dinner and Supper in publick, beſides Preachings twice on the</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, <hi>on</hi> Tueſdays, <hi>and other extraordinary Times. I dare ſay, that if his Advice had been followed, all the Blood that is ſhed, and all the Rapine committed, might have been prevented.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Confeſſion of Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> is confirmed in few words by Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> who heard him diſputing a whole Day with fifteen Commiſſioners and Counſellors, and four Divines, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerning Church-Affairs, on the Propoſitions ſent him, to their Conviction, who coming prejudiced againſt him as a Man of ſlender Parts, went away admiring how he became ſo Learned, and prevailed with their Maſters, that his Conceſſions might be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Ground for a Treaty, which was voted to be with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Honour, Safety, and Freedom; the Succeſs whereof <hi>Cromwell</hi> feared, and foreſaw, for he charged ſuch of the Commiſſioners that he could beſt confide in, to be careful what Conceſſions they made, for he feared the King would be too ſubtle for them. But Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> the moſt able of the Divines, repented of his being deluded to ſuch unworthy Thoughts of the King, and gave him great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and perſuaded others to do ſo, ſaying, <hi>He was ſorry the King was no better underſtood, for he thought him the best Divine of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lay-man in</hi> England. And the Diſpute with <hi>Henderſon,</hi> and this of the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> do ſufficiently manifeſt his great Abilities and Vertues; which were ſuch, that when a Diſpute aroſe in favour of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99534:29"/>
                  <hi>Cromwell, Whether a King or no King? Henry Martyn</hi> told the Houſe, <hi>If we must have a King, we had rather have kept him,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>King</hi> Charles, <hi>than any Gentleman in the Nation.</hi> And others ſaid, <hi>If he had not been born to be a King, no Man deſerved it better.</hi> So that by the Confeſſion of his Enemies, his greateſt Fault was, that he was born to be a King, and that God had anointed him above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>Theſe great and good Qualities of his Majeſty made his Enemies ſo averſe from imbracing his often renewed Solicitations for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace, eſpecially when he deſired a Perſonal Treaty, for they could not but obſerve, how by ſtrength of Reaſon, and Meekneſs, and Piety of Converſation: He made Proſelites of ſuch as had the Happineſs to converſe with him, whoſe Prejudices and Prepoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions he quite extinguiſhed, and made them more real Friends than they had been Enemies.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> his Letter to the Army on the behalf of the King, urgeth, <hi>That the King was renowned by ſome of themſelves for the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Underſtanding, and many other Princely Vertues and Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Endowments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here I might enquire, 1. How well Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> was qualified for this Work. And, 2. At what time he may be ſuppoſed to have begun and finiſhed it, for he muſt be a Man of extraordinary Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, of great Experience, and diligent Inſpection into the Polity and Intrigues of the Times, and one that wrote Memorials of them while they were freſh in Memory, one that was deeply concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and after long and mature Deliberation, digeſted them: And who but the King was ſufficient for theſe things? Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> probably might have heard, as many did, that the King had begun ſuch Meditations; and having ſuch an Opinion of his great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, could not with any good Manners take the Work out of his hands. But ſuppoſe the Doctor had been competently qualified for ſuch a Work, what time might be allowed for compleating of ſuch an incomparable Work? Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, <hi>He that would imitate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother's Stile, ought to be well acquainted with it, and beſtow first, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third Thoughts.</hi> And this ought to be done with greater Deliberation where the Work is more difficult to be imitated by reaſon of its Excellency and Perfection, and the Undertaker of a Genius agreeable to the Work: And if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> were a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanter, as Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> ſays, if his Stile and Genius were ſuch in 48 as it was in 61, if we hear not of any Correſpondence between
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99534:30"/>him and the Royaliſts until the time that the Book was ordered for the Preſs by the King himſelf, if after that it is ſuppoſed to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> it was tranſcribed by Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> and ſent to the King by the E. of <hi>Hertford,</hi> in <hi>November</hi> 48, after which ſome things were added by the King, it will appear that ſuch a Book as this which for one that was a Stranger to the Subject muſt be more than the Work of one Year, eſpecially for a Man not duly qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, as the King himſelf was confeſſed to be by Friends and Foes, for his Pen was incomparably the moſt Princely and beſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in his time, in the Council none reaſoned more like a Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, among the Lawyers as an Oracle, in the Camp like <hi>Coeſar,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Biſhops as a <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in the Temple as a Saint, on the Scaffold as an undanted Martyr, who by his Arguments was more than Conqueror over them who overcame him by their brutiſh Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Arms; in a word, one of his greateſt Failings was the exceſs of his Clemency, diſtruſt of his own Judgment, and his eaſie Conceſſions to his ſubtile Adverſaries, to whoſe Importunity he granted ſo much till they had no more to ask, nor he to give, and ſome of them were not aſhamed to provoke him the more becauſe they knew he had Charity enough to forgive them all; and indeed he forgave them that could not forgive themſelves, ſuch as God hath ſaid he will not forgive, who continue to offend out of mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Wickedneſs: Being ask'd of C. <hi>Hammond</hi> his Jaylor, <hi>What Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret his Spirit had against his Enemies;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>I can forgive them, Collonel, with as good an Appetite, as ever I eat my Meat after Hunting, and that I'll aſſure thee was no ſmall one.</hi> In his Meditations on Death, he prays not ſo much that the bitter Cup of a violent Death may paſs from him, as that of God's Wrath may paſs from all thoſe whoſe hands by deſerting him were ſprinkled, or by act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or conſenting to his Death were embrued with his Bloud.</p>
               <p>After theſe Acknowledgements of his Enemies, it were as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as it is endleſs to ſum up the Teſtimonies of ſuch of his Friends as beſt knew him, and his Converſation, As, firſt, of his Father, who could well judge of his Proficiency in Learning and Piety; of which I have given an account. Secondly, His Vertuous Brother Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who perceiving how ſtudious and reſerved his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, took the Archbiſhop's Cap and put it on his head, ſaying, <hi>If I live</hi> Charles, <hi>I will make thee Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury.</p>
               <p>At the Age of Thirteen, on <hi>Eaſter-Munday</hi> 1613, he was ſtrictly examined in order to his Confirmation, by two Biſhops, in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99534:30"/>of Dr. <hi>Hackwell</hi> his Tutor, to the great ſatisfaction of them all.</p>
               <p>He read and noted ſeveral good Authors, and contracted their Arguments into a narrow but clear compaſs, ſuch as <hi>Hooker,</hi> Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Arguments againſt <hi>Fiſher</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, of which he made excellent uſe in his Diſpute with <hi>Henderſon</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the Divines ſent to worry him at the <hi>Iſle of Wight.</hi> But they that will not be perſuaded by what hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, neither will they believe though one ſhould riſe from the Dead, no nor then neither will theſe Infidels be perſwaded, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as his Majeſty both prayed, and foretold God hath in great Mercy granted the Royal Family and the Church which died with the Father and roſe again with the Son, a Reſtauration moſt like to a Reſurrection from the Dead, yet will they not be perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to prevent their ſeducing of others, I proceed, 2ly, to ſhew that the King did deſign this Work, for although Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> pretends that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> would excuſe his impoſing this Book on the World, by ſhewing the Title, and ſaying, <hi>No Man uſeth to draw his own Picture;</hi> yet we know that <hi>Coeſar</hi> did, and none but <hi>Coeſar</hi> could write his own Commentaries; ſo did that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and Philoſopher <hi>Antoninus</hi> in that excellent Book <hi>De Seipſo,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Merike Caſaubon</hi> in his <hi>Engliſhing</hi> that Book calleth his Meditations. And how uſual is it for great Men to keep Diaries of their ſpecial Actions and Concerns, as Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> did.</p>
               <p>After which Examples the King may be preſumed to have done the like; and that he did deſign ſo to do hath been ſhewn by the undoubted Evidences which have been manifeſted, concerning ſome Chapters of that Book taken at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and reſtored by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Huntington</hi> to the King at <hi>Holmeby;</hi> to which I may add, that he began it while he was beſieged in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and more yet when confined at <hi>Holmeby,</hi> and that the whole was finiſhed by his own hand at the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> where they were ſeen both by Friends and Enemies even by Col. <hi>Hammond</hi> himſelf, and that Captain of whom Bp. <hi>Fowler</hi> produceth a ſufficient Teſtimony that he was convinced of his Majeſty's Piety and Innocence, by reading his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, which made him lay down his Commiſſion, and become a Convert, as Major <hi>Huntington</hi> had done before.</p>
               <p>In a Book called the <hi>Princely Pellican,</hi> printed 1649, the Author gives us (as he affirms in the Title-page) ſatisfactory Reaſons that his Sacred Majeſty was the ſole Author of the Book in queſtion, which he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99534:31"/>wrote at the inſtance of ſeveral Perſons of Quality, who knew him to have been a conſtant Attender on his Majeſty's Perſon, againſt ſuch Reflection as had been publiſhed againſt thoſe Divine Eſſays, and firſt he tells, us that the occaſion of them was, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had miſrepreſented him to his People, of which he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe words, <hi>O that my Subjects knew the Integrity of my Heart towards them, and that as they could not ſee his Heart, ſo neither would the Parliament permit his Preſence to plead his own Cauſe.</hi> But many odious, ſcurrilous, and treacherous Libels were publiſhed againſt him, which yet he peruſed with a modeſt Smile, ſaying, <hi>I intend to wipe off theſe with a Spunge of Truth; it ſhall be my Task at ſpare hours, and many ſuch it ſeems my Parliament will admit me, to undeceive my People, and to rectifie their miſguided Judgments.</hi> Theſe were the grounds, ſays that Author, which induced his Majeſty to this Work: After this the King in his Garden at <hi>Theobalds</hi> communicated this Deſign to ſome of his Gentlemen of whoſe Abilities he was moſt confident, particularly that he would ſhew the Reaſon of his Receding from the Parliament, which he hoped would be to the full Satisfaction of his Subjects, and of which he ſaid, <hi>That not one Line had fallen from his Pen which he might not confirm with Honour, were it racked by never ſo rigid and uncharitable Conſtruction.</hi> Then he told us, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Subject of his writing ſhould be, <hi>The most Faithful Servant and Incomparable States-man that any Chriſtian Prince could rely upon; one</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>whom I cannot without a pious and religious Sorrow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, condemning myſelf in nothing more than ſuffering my Hand to thwart the Reſolution of my Heart, having ſo expreſly delivered my Thoughts, and in ſo publick a manner as beſides my own conſciencious Fears which inceſſantly awaken'd me, the Relation of ſo ungrateful an Action cannot but in ſucceeding Times ſucceed highly to my Diſhonour.</hi> To which a Gentleman of his Privy Chamber made anſwer, <hi>That this could not be imputed to his Majeſty, but to their Doctrinal Aſſurance, who maintained the Conveniency of it.</hi> To which, with a deep Sigh, the King replied, <hi>It is not ſafe for Princes to pin their Faith on Timing Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates ſleeves, their future account ſhall neither leſſen my Guilt nor ſolve my Honour.</hi> And when another Gentleman ſaid, <hi>Sir, If the ſence of that Action have ſo ſtrong an influence on your Thoughts, I hold it a more Princely Act rather to cloſe then to lay open ſuch a Wound to your Fame. Oh no! in no caſes,</hi> (Ned) ſaid his Majeſty, <hi>the way to cure Wounds is not to cloſe but to diſcover them, they rankle by being cloſed before they be cured: As for Princely Pollicy, I hold none better than ſincere Piety, it is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99534:31"/>my conſtant Reſolve, and ſhall be my daily Prayer, that my Sins may be ever before me, for there is ſuch precious Eye-ſalve in a pious Tear that it allays the Diſtemper of an afflicted Spirit.</hi> The next thing the King reflected on was, how contrary the Actings of the Parliament were to their Promiſes in making him a moſt glorious King, on which he ſaid, <hi>It ſhould be his most ſupream Care to rely on God's ſacred Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which I am confident will never fail me, but full of Deceit is the Heart of Man.</hi> In this manner ſays the Author, frequently and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently did the King deliver his Mind, and return to his Study. The Author alſo gives the reaſon why his Majeſty concluded every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with a diſtinct Pſalmody, <hi>It was obſerved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Chaplains, and by us that waited on him, that though he ſpake oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally of all parts of Scripture, yet he took ſuch Comfort in the Pſalms of</hi> David, <hi>that he would uſually repeat whole Pſalms: Mentioning that of St.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>In every part of Scripture I find ſomething uſeful, but in the Book of Pſalms I find a Store-houſe of all things; and if</hi> David <hi>a Man after God's own Heart, were ſo afflicted, that not only his Enemies but his familiar Friends who fed at his Table, made that a Snare to ketch him, what may I expect in theſe evil days?</hi> He acknowledged God's Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him in afflicting him, which he thus expreſſed, <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and applied it to myſelf, and found Comfort in the Application, how when many Children were playing the Wags in the Street, one amongst the rest was taken hold of and corrected, and I found it to be by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Child, and that 'twas his Affection that cauſed him to correct it; this is my Heavenly Father's courſe with me, and I kiſs his Rod, his Afflictions hath gained me a Tongue for Paſſion,</hi> (ſaid the King) <hi>which made my Tongue inarticulate, and the long courſe of Sufferings hath ſo leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen'd my Opinion of Sufferings, that Paſſion is now a Stranger to me, and I think myſelf happy in the chearful imbracing of my Unhappineſs, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte of the Publick hath made me my own private Secretary.</hi> Then he mentioneth with what Comfort the King received theſe Papers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Naſeby</hi> Fight, ſaying, <hi>I ſee that the gracious Eye of Heaven would not ſuffer me to be deprived of all Comfort: Poſterity ſhall ſee by theſe Papers that I know how to ſubdue my own Paſſion, and ſolace myſelf with Divine Comforts in the height of my Affliction; though the Enemy gain the Field, a compoſed Patience ſhall crown me with a braver Victory; I know no Triumph more Abſolute than a Self-Conquest.</hi> The Author adds, <hi>That his Majeſty's Idiom was ſo well known not only to his Attendants and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but to forreign Kings and States, that none but ſuch as were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Weakneſs or Perverſneſs, could queſtion his Ability for ſuch a Work.</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:99534:32"/>His own Teſtimony at his Tryal that he knew the Laws of the Kingdom as well as any Gentleman that did not make Profeſſion of them, is an Authentick Proof of his Ability.</p>
               <p>Another Argument I ſhall urge is, the vaſt difference between the Kings Stile not only in his Portraicture, but in many other Writings, as may be ſeen firſt in ſeveral of thoſe Letters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which were taken at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> and ſet forth by the Parliament as the King's, of which tho they intended to make an ill uſe, yet as his Majeſty obſerves on that Subject, <hi>His Enemies might be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by them he could both mind and act his own and his Kingdom's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, ſo as becomes a Prince, which my Enemies are loath ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of me, as if I were wholly confined to the Dictates and Directions of others whom they brand with the name of Evil Counſellors.</hi> He that believeth the Diſputations that paſt between his Majeſty and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and theſe between him and the Commiſſioners in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> which his Enemies knew to be his, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and <hi>viva voce</hi> managed, and were admired by his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, muſt own the King's Ability, and ſee the ſame ſtrength and nerves in the Chapter of Church-Government, though in the one he urgeth them as a Diſputant, in the other as an Orator, but like himſelf in all: Both Diſputes are to be ſeen among his other Works. I ſhall chooſe to commend ſuch Works as are beſt known to be his Majeſty's, and recommend thoſe which he wrote during his ſtrict Confinement in <hi>Carisbrook</hi> after the Vote of Non-addreſſes, which may be ſeen <hi>p.</hi> 279. of his Works, to 295, which will ſhew a great Identity both in his way of Arguing, and in the Stile.</p>
               <p>After this to recompence my Reader's pains, (if at leaſt he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it ſo) I ſhall compare Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Stile with the King's; I chooſe a Book which the Doctor wrote concerning the Covenant, to ſee whether he did imitate his Majeſty in writing on that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauſe Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> affirms that Chapter was written by Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> defend himſelf againſt ſome that ſaid he wrote Nonſence, whom he anſwers in theſe words, <hi>p.</hi> 19. of his <hi>Anti-Baal,</hi> 
                  <q>He tells his Reader how the City of <hi>London</hi> were affected with Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Pious Nonſence and Honeſt Blaſphemy,</q> when preaching at St. <q>
                     <hi>Paul</hi>'s before the Lord-Mayor and General <hi>Monke,</hi> he did ſo A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomize thoſe cruel Medicaſters and crafty Empiricks of the Times, the ſlight Healers who made their Profit and Pleaſure out of the Diſeaſes, Pain, and Miſeries of their Country; How did the Rumpers then rage and tremble at the Truth and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99534:32"/>of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Nonſence? How were the Regicides aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Sword of his Mouth, that Word of God? How were the Sacrilegious Merchants of Church Lands appaled before that Blaſphemy, which being like Thunder and Lightning by Dr. <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s Tongue and Pen quite blaſted, all the Glory of their Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, of which ſo ſeaſonable Sermons and Writings, eſpecially that of the Tears of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Libeller expreſſeth a deep ſence, for from that time the bloody <hi>Babel</hi> fell, and could riſe no more from that day: Many wicked Men began to look what Rocks and Mountains might cover them; and by this time they may have a quicker ſence of Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Nonſence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they have thick Skins, brawny Hearts, and cauteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Conſciences.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You ſhall ſeldom find the Genius of two Authors more differing than theſe of the King and the Doctor; his Majeſty's Diſcourſes were exceeding rational and curt, but very convincing, and the Meekneſs of his Expreſſions inſinuated as Oyl to mollifie the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Temper: <hi>By your Favour Sir,</hi> was his uſual Condeſcention in his Diſputes; yea, even at his Tryal to <hi>Bradſhaw:</hi> In every Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph of his there is as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a great height of Reaſon and Contemplation to entertain the learned, and a great Plainneſs and Facility of Sence and Expreſſion; ſo that as ſome ſay of the Scripture, The Elephant may ſwim, and the Lamb wade through. Dr. <hi>Walker</hi> talked of peculiar Expreſſions uſed by Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> in his private Devotion, but names not one. I beg the Reader's Patience therefore to repeat a few of them in the Book lately quoted, <hi>p.</hi> 10. he ſays, <hi>His Adverſary ſtruts in his Rhodomontade Titles of Defiance, in his prodigious Railings, in his ſarcaſtical Ironies, in his ſophiſtical Sophiſms, in his dull Argumentations, in his ſpecious Pretences of Zeal, and Clamors for Reformation.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 13. ſpeaking of his Analiſis of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, he talks of the ſolid weight and Divine Truth of that free and rational Analiſis void of Obſcurity, Popularity, Partiality, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, or Flattery. <hi>P.</hi> 16. he tells his Adverſaries of their Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, their Idolized Sacrilegious Sectors and Paſquil Oratory, the Atrocity of their Facts and Impudicities, a By-blow of Devotion, the <hi>Gorgon</hi>'s Head, and Devil of <hi>Maſcow,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Aſmodeus,</hi> Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardike Presbyters, Taliſmanik Charms; he calls them Medicaſters and crafty Empyricks, compares his two Opponents to <hi>Sancho Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> and <hi>Don Quixot,</hi> with their Pickvant Darts and Lippient Eyes, Heards of good Words, and Flooks of Figures. It is a wonder, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99534:33"/>others have obſerved, that if Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> had penned that Book, that no ſuch Expreſſions are found in it, no not one, when his Writings are ſtuft with Bombaſt, and <hi>Greek</hi> Words, and <hi>Latine</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, yea, with ſome of his Peculiarities Dr. <hi>W.</hi> calls them, ſuch as his <hi>Analeptist, Cacotomy, Impoſtarage, Borborites, Graſſant, Traculent, Brontes, Fanto, Farrago, Paradoe, Sempervive, Corbonist, Ecobolian, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſectical, Symoniack, Privado, Offa</hi> and <hi>Buccoone, Cordolium, Ephialta, Parrheſy, Caecinnations, Diaboletto's;</hi> and many ſuch other Expreſſions which may deſerve an Explanation when <hi>Blunt</hi>'s or <hi>Chamberlain</hi>'s Dictionary of hard Words are next printed. How one ſmall Book ſhould abound with ſuch Words and Phraſes, and not one of them in the King's Book, conſidering how fond the Doctor ſeems to be of them, is a probable Argument that the Doctor had no hand in that Book. Beſides it is a wonder to think, how Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> at or before 48 ſhould be Maſter of ſo grave, ſignificant and polite Stile, and in the Year 61, ſhould when he was a Biſhop, uſe ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick, Verboſe and almoſt Barbarous Stile; this is another Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convince that not Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> but the King was the Author of that Book.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould trace all the Footſteps and Characters of the King's Image and Superſcription, I muſt tranſcribe the whole, which is an expreſs Image of his Royal Soul, which as the Philoſophers ſay of the Souls informing the Body is, <hi>Tota in toto &amp; tota in qualibet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te;</hi> His humble Confeſſions, his ſolemn Appeals to God, his Vows and Reſolutions to perſevere in ſuffering any Affliction rather than to break the Peace of his Conſcience, or be guilty of deſerting the Church, which he ſhewed to be dearer than his Life. He that will find a Parallel to the Life and Writings of our Royal Martyr, muſt aſcend to the Apoſtolical and Primitive Times, for among all our Modern Examples if there may be any one found that may be compared with him in any one Grace or Vertue, yet there is none that comes near him for all thoſe Graces which ſhined in him, as illuſtriouſly as the Sun doth above the other Luminaries: Where is there ſuch an inſtance of Condeſcention and Charity to Enemies, of greater Love and Conſtancy to his Friends, of Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Submiſſion in Affliction, of Humility and Devotion to God, of the Contempt of Death in its moſt terrible Approaches, and dreadful Aſpect? That which would have aſtoniſhed and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified the Spirits of other Men, comforted and elevated his Paſſage from a Crown of Thorns to a Crown of Glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:99534:33"/>The next Argument to prove that the King was the Author of this Book, is the Teſtimony of thoſe ſeveral Perſons which were concerned in the Printing and Publiſhing of his Majeſty's Book; and firſt I have this Teſtimony from Mr. <hi>John Norman,</hi> who was well acquainted with Mr. <hi>Royſton,</hi> when the Book was firſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who had it from Mr. <hi>Royſon</hi>'s own mouth, <hi>viz. That there was Information given that ſuch a Book was to be printed, and great Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were uſed to prevent it, but that he had removed a Preſs at ſome diſtance from the City to ſecure the Impreſſion; which he did, and ſpeedily finiſhed it, not without ſome Hazard, there being diligent Search made in all the known Printers Houſes for it: but in one night he cauſed ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hawkers to come to a certain place where the Books were delivered them, and they ſold above two thouſand Copies for the price of</hi> 15 s. <hi>each: That the Care and Chargewhich he uſed for concealing the Impreſſion, cost him ſome hundreds of Pounds, which notwithſtanding he was taken up on Suſpicion, and made a Priſoner, till after ſome time he had his Liberty on giving</hi> 500 l. <hi>Bail.</hi> Now what cauſed this great Care and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in Mr. <hi>Royſton,</hi> but the Letter which he had formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the King to prepare a Preſs for ſome Papers which ſhould be ſent him? What cauſed ſo great Endeavours to ſuppreſs them, but becauſe they were truly informed that the King had of a long time been writing ſomewhat in Vindication of himſelf, and they had a hint that it was then in the Preſs. Mr. <hi>Norman</hi> is an aged Perſon well known in the City of <hi>Exon,</hi> and County of <hi>Devon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be too tedious to recite all the Teſtimonies of thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Perſons who had a hand in Methodizing the looſe Papers, in Tranſcribing, and Publiſhing them in Print, as Sir <hi>John Brattle</hi> and his Father, Mr. <hi>Odert,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> the Tranſcribers, Mr. <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Simmonds,</hi> and others concerned in the Printing, whoſe Teſtimonies have been produced, and are above all Exception: And yet his Majeſty's own Teſtimony, though he bore Witneſs of himſelf, is moſt material, for in that Letter to the Prince from the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> which I preſume none could be ſo daring to write in his Majeſty's Name, and publiſh it while he was living, and might have ſurvived much longer, and call the Queen his Wife, and the Prince his Son, and preſcribe Rules to him, he thus begins, <hi>Son if thoſe Papers, with ſome others wherein I have ſet down the private Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of my Conſcience, and my most Impartial Thoughts touching the chief Paſſages which have been most remarkable or diſputed in my late Troubles, come to your hands, to whom they are chiefly deſigned, they may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99534:34"/>be ſo far uſeful to you as to ſtate your Judgment aright, as to what is past, whereof a pious is the best uſe that can be made: And they may alſo give you ſome Directions how to remedy the preſent Diſtempers, and prevent (if GOD will) the like for the time to come. It is ſome kind of leſſening and deceiving the Injury of my long Reſtraint, when I find my Laeiſure and Solitude have produced ſomething worthy of myſelf, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to you, that neither you nor any other may hereafter meaſure my Cauſe by the Succeſs, nor my Judgment of Things by my Misfortune,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot think that any but the King could be the Author of this Letter, <hi>1st,</hi> Becauſe it is affirmed by many that it was delivered to Biſhop <hi>Juxton</hi> to be conveyed to the Prince. <hi>2ly,</hi> Becauſe as K. <hi>James,</hi> his Father, had left large Inſtructions to his Son, with a Charge to obſerve them, which he called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him, King <hi>Charles</hi> would not leave the World without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Son whom he left in a Sea of Troubles, without ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, which he had learned by long Experience, how to ſteer his Courſe: And if this Letter be the King's, we have an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the reſt of his Meditations were ſo too, to which the King refers the Prince for further Direction. One inſtance I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not omit, becauſe I think that this being joyned with that of the Letter to the Prince, may, if well conſidered, put an end to the Controverſie, it is the Anſwer which the King made to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> when they preſt him to yield to their Deſires for the Abrogating of Epiſcopacy in <hi>England.</hi> To which Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> ſays the King anſwered, <hi>That he had granted all he could to ſave his Life, which might conſist with the ſaving of his Soul.</hi> And being urged again, <hi>That his Majeſty had aboliſhed Epiſcopacy in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He anſwer'd, <hi>That it is no Plea to ſin again becauſe he had once ſinned in this kind, but rather to repent and do ſo no more.</hi> This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the King's Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> might have known in the Year 1661, when he quoted it in <hi>Anti-Baal,</hi> p. 134. but he could not know it ſo early as to place it in the middle of the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, if he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that Book, the Chapter being the 17th of that Book, was in all probability written by the King ſome Years before, which was not known to the Biſhop before that Book was printed: But the King had opportunity after the Treaty to correct, alter, and add what he thought fit, till his cloſe Impriſonment; ſo that he had either written the Anſwer which we have in that Chapter before, (which the Doctor had not ſeen ſo long ago as to write it in that place) or inſerted it after the Treaty was over; the King's Anſwer
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99534:34"/>is this: <hi>If any ſhall impute my yielding to them</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Scots) <hi>as my Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sin, I can eaſily acknowledge it; but that is no Argument to do ſo again, or much worſe, being now more convinced in that Point; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath my yielding to them been ſo Happy and Succeſsful as to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age me to grant the like to others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it ſo likely that the Biſhop would accuſe the King of Sin, (though he doth it himſelf,) which might have put a better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into his Enemies mouths than any the had invented againſt him, <hi>(viz.) His Obſtinacy to grant that to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>which he had granted to the</hi> Scots.</p>
               <p>More Inſtances may be collected from almoſt every Chapter by the Judicious, to convince him that not Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> but the King was the Author of that Book: I ſuppoſe therefore that the King might inſert that Anſwer after he had given it to the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners at the Treaty, for evident it is, that the Title was altered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Book was in the Preſs by the King's order, on Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Letter, which is another good Argument. That Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Title (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to evade the Fault of impoſing a Book of his own on the Nation in the King's Name, was a meer Fiction of Dr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s; for the Book which was ſent to the Preſs had another Title, <hi>viz. Suſpiria Regalia: or, The Royal Defence;</hi> and was not altered until the Book was begun to be printed.</p>
               <p>I am loath to defile my hands again by medling with <hi>Milton,</hi> but I muſt to ſtop the foul Mouths of ſome People whom he hath taught to object, that his Majeſty made uſe of a Prayer made by a Heathen to a falſe God or Goddeſs in time of Captivity. To which I anſwer, <hi>1st,</hi> By denying what <hi>Milton</hi> ſays, <hi>That the King had unhallowed and unchriſtned Chriſtianiſm, by borrowing to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an uſe Prayers offered to a Heathen God.</hi> To which Dr. <hi>Earle</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Milton</hi> ſaith, <hi>Did St.</hi> Paul <hi>by applying to a Chriſtian uſe the Words of a Heathen Philoſopher and Poet, unhallow the Scripture?</hi> Doth not <hi>Milton</hi> confeſs that Book of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi>'s is full of Wit and Worth? And why might not a Chriſtian Prince collect what is good out of a worthy Book of ſuch a Religious Author, for Sir <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> was known to be a Man of great Piety and Wiſdom, as well as of Courage and Wit: I have heard that the King for his Recreation did divert himſelf by reading that Book, the beſt of its kind then extant; and he did it with great Obſervation and good Improvement. Now which is more commendable, the King who made his very Recreations ſubſervient to his Devotion, or
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99534:35"/>thoſe Adverſaries of his that prophaned the Scriptures and their Prayers with preaching up Rebellion, Curſing the King, and vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Malice and bitter Paſſions againſt their Brethren? The King had great Examples for what he did, no leſs than of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who in the Inſtitution of both Sacraments, and in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Form of Prayer for his Diſciples, made uſe both of the Matter and Words which were uſed by the <hi>Jews,</hi> adapting them to his Sacred Ordinances, that are to continue till the World's end: And when <hi>Celſus</hi> objected to St. <hi>Origen, That he could parallel most of our Saviour's Precepts with the Saying of ſome of his Heathens; Origen</hi> thought it a great Recommendation of the Evangelical Precepts, that they ſo well accorded with the Moral and Natural Truths which the Reaſon of Mankind did approve of. Were the <hi>Jews</hi> ever blamed for Adorning the Temple with the Riches and Spoil of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Did not <hi>Solomon</hi> borrow Materials and Architecks from an Idolatrous King, to build the Temple of the True God? God permitted his own People to do what the King (if he did it) hath done: They might marry a <hi>Moabitiſh</hi> Woman that was a Captive, after her Purification by paring her Nails and ſhaving her Hair, and ſo ſhe became a Daughter of <hi>Sion.</hi> It is eaſie to collect from ſuch Heathen as <hi>Seneca, M. Antonius Epictetus, M. Tyrias,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch Petitions to their Unknown Gods, as might ſhame the haſty Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues of many who profeſs a more perfect Knowledge than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the True God.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Patrick</hi> in his <hi>Parable of the Pilgrim,</hi> written after the manner of a Romance, hath ſaid more to inſinuate Piety and Devotion to the Hearts of his Readers, than can be found in all the Sermons writ by <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s and the Army-Chaplains, whoſe Preaching and Prayers were of Curſing and Lies, as <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>The PRAYER objected is in theſe Words:</label>
                  <q>
                     <p>O Powerful and Eternal GOD, to whom nothing is ſo great that it may reſiſt, or ſo ſmall that it is contemned, look upon my Miſery with Thine Eye of Mercy, and let Thy infinite Power vouchſafe to limit out ſome Proportion of Deliverance unto me, as to Thee ſhall ſeem moſt convenient: Let not Injury, O Lord, triumph over me; Let my Faults by Thy Hand be corrected, and make not my unjuſt Enemies the Miniſters of Thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but yet, my GOD, if in Thy Wiſdom this be the apteſt Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for my Unexcuſable Trangreſſions, if this ungrateful Bondage be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99534:35"/>for my over-high Deſires; if the Pride of my (not enough humble) Heart be thus to be broken: O Lord, I yield unto thy Will, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbrace what Sorrow thou wilt have me ſuffer; only thus much let me crave of thee, (let my craving, O Lord, be accepted of, ſince it even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from thee,) That by thy Goodneſs, which is thyſelf, thou wilt ſuffer ſome Beam of thy Majeſty ſo to ſhine in my Mind, that I who acknowledge it my nobleſt Title to be thy Creature, may ſtill in my greateſt Afflictions, depend conſiderably on thee, let Calamity be the Exerciſe but not the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of my Virtue: O let not their prevailing Power be to my Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and if it be thy Will that they more and more weaken me with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, yet, O Lord, never let their Wickedneſs have ſuch a hand but that I may ſtill carry a pure Mind and ſtedfaſt Reſolution ever to ſerve thee without Fear or Preſumption, yet with that humble Confidence which may pleaſe thee, ſo that at the laſt I may come to thy Eternal Kingdom, through the Merits of thy Son, our alone Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now who could find ſuch a Jewel, though lying in a Dung-hill, and not think it worthy to be taken up and ſet in Gold? Yet be it known, that this Prayer was not the Conception of a Heathen to a Pagan God, but of a ſerious and eminent Chriſtian to direct others how to Addreſs themſelves to the True GOD in time of Extremity; for as it was the Buſineſs even of Heathen Poets and Satyriſts to expoſe Vice and commend Virtue in their Satyrs and Interludes; ſo and much more was it intended by that noble Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon throughout his <hi>Arcadia.</hi> 'Tis an excellent Directory for Prayer, which <hi>Perſius,</hi> none of the beſt Poets, hath given,

                  </q> Now who can wonder that the King is blamed for uſing this Prayer by them that reject our Lord's Prayer. This yet I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the Honour of his Majeſty, that what his Enemies would account a Virtue in others, they impute as a Fault to him, his moſt innocent Actions are charged with tranſcendent Guilt, their tranſcendent Guilt repreſented as pious Actions, for thus that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant diſcants on the finding this Prayer printed among the King's Papers, <hi>Who would have imagined ſo little Rear in him of the True All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing Deity, ſo little Reverence of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Office it is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99534:36"/>and preſent our Chriſtian Prayers, ſo little Care of Truth in his laſt Words, or Honour to himſelf or to his Friends, or Sence of his Afflictions, or of that ſad Hour which was upon him, as immediately before his Death to pop into the hand of that grave Biſhop who attended him, as a ſpecial Relique of his Family Exerciſe, a Prayer ſtollen out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Deviliſh Invective he makes that which he calls the ſtoln Prayer; But what one Sentence or Word in all that Prayer may not become a Chriſtian in his deepeſt Affliction? Do all that pray by ſet Forms deſpiſe the Office of the Holy Ghoſt? What ſhall become then of all thoſe Primitive Chriſtians, and the Reformed Churches that pray by Forms? And how can be fix that Helliſh Accuſation of his Majeſty on a falſe Conceit, that this was the Prayer uſed by him in his laſt Words? This is a Suggeſtion of his own Malice and Deluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> This Prayer was not heard of until a conſiderable time after the King's Death: I have ſeen his Majeſty's Book printed and reprinted, one of which I can produce where there is no Footſtep of this Prayer, it might perhaps be found among ſome other looſe Papers of his Majeſty, which the Printer for his Benefit, finding how great Eſteem the People had of his Majeſty's Devotions, clapt in with his Book, as we are wont to bind up the Apocripha with the Canonical Scriptures. This therefore is the Malice of a Rebel, and the Scoff of an Atheiſt, of one that exceeds the Grand Regicide <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> who when Mr. <hi>Royſton</hi> told him on his Oath, <hi>That he knew no other but that it was the King's Book;</hi> Askt him, <hi>How he could believe that ſo ill a Man could make ſo good a Book?</hi> And how, ſay I, could ſo good a Book be made by an ill Man? The whole Book was but a Tranſcript of his Life, which anſwer each other as Face to Face; as <hi>Philo</hi> in the Life of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſuch as his Words were ſuch were his Deeds; as in a Muſical Inſtrument all was Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Uniform, his Heart and Mind was ſeen in his Actions, and his Actions expreſſed in lively, charming, pious, and powerful Words.</p>
               <p>Thus lived this Glorious King, and thus he died as another <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> though of a ſtammering Tongue, yet Mighty in Words and Deeds; his whole Life, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſays, was a Martyrdom to God, being worried by the Contradiction of a Rebellious People, who choſe Idols to go before them, a <hi>Chorah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> he was the meekeſt Man on the Earth, when a rude Souldier ſpit in his Face, he wiped it off with a pious
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99534:36"/>Thought, <hi>My Saviour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>endured this and more for my ſake.</hi> He was not appaled when he ſaw the Red Sea before him, and Armies of <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Souldiers on every ſide, he did not as <hi>Moſes, exceedingly quake and fear,</hi> being more concerned for his Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers than for himſelf: And as <hi>Philo</hi> ſays of <hi>Moſes, Non calligavit ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus nec mutatus eſt ſplendor gratiae ejus;</hi> As Majeſtick on the Scaffold as on the Throne; which he aſcended as more than Conqueror from an <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof he had a full Proſpect from his Mount <hi>Piſgah;</hi> there he Bleſſed the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of their future Proſperity, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. There God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to go up with him and give him Reſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.14. There he could converſe with God as a Man with his Friend, face to face: And having prayed to ſee the Glory of God, it was wonderfully diſplayed before him, as in <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. in Grace and Mercy to him, and in Terrour to his Enemies, that were guilty of his Death. And ſo he died as the Rabbins ſay, <hi>With a Kiſs of GOD's Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Malice of his Enemies is not yet dead, for the Devil and his Angels are ſtill diſputing with <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels about his Book, as they did about the Body of <hi>Moſes, (i. e.)</hi> as ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it the Book of his Law and Inſtructions for the Service of God; the reaſon is the ſame as is given why the Apoſtate <hi>Julian</hi> removed the Bones of <hi>Babylas</hi> the Martyr, becauſe as long as the Relicks of the Martyr were ſo nigh, the Devil's Oracles could not aſſiſt him; nor will the Conſults of Papiſts, Republicans, or Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides have any Operation upon us, as long as the <hi>Reliquiae Carolina</hi> have their due Reſpect and Influence upon us.</p>
